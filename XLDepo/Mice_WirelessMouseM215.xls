OK for a basic mouse. Disappointed that even though you set the wheel to double-click, it apparently does not have that capability.|Myself|August 25, 2010
I just love this mouse. Very comfortable and easy to install. Works and feels great. Perfect for work and games.|Luthien Tinuviel|August 16, 2010
I bought this M215 mouse because old one, which was Microsoft memory mouse quit working. I loved how simply it installed and even though I just started using it, I really like the performance. Great product, especially for the price.|Notverytechy|August 10, 2010
I'm from Malaysia, bought this mouse in PC Fair for RM59, it's worth for the money.Pros:1) Ease of installation - Ready for use within seconds2) Tiny receiver - Ideal for laptop3) Slot for receiver storage4) Ergonomic - Concave on left/right button is good (proved that Logitech designing team really put some efforts in designing)Cons:1) Loose battery compartment - Can feel the battery "shaking" sometimes when moving the mouse too fast.2) On/Off button - Located at the bottom right of the back of mouse, prefer it to be at the top center area for ergonomic purpose and ease of operate with thumb only.3) Small size - Too small for my big palm, but I just use it occasionally with my netbook, so it is not a big deal.Suggestion: This mice will be PERFECT if there is a back button for internet surfing :D|CS|August 5, 2010
I bought this on sale at Walmart for $20 to use with my new Alienware M15x. The M215 is a great buy. Usually the packaging is a pain to deal with, but I was pleasantly surprised by the easy open "pull here" packaging, I didn't even need scissors! Installation was easy, all I had to do was put the mini receiver (about the size of a dime) into the USB slot and turn on the mouse and it worked right away with no software! The maneuverability is great, the response time is phenomenal! The features are basic, only left click, right click, and scroll wheel. However, that was all I was looking for so it is great for me. It's size is a little smaller than I'm used to, but I find that I have to move this mouse less to get the cursor to move the same distance compared to a larger mouse. For a general size reference on a small- medium-large scale the M215 is definitely small. The performance is simply the best compared to all the other products I have used. For $20 you can't go wrong. With the performance this has I can't imagine what a true gaming Logitech mouse must be like. I'd highly recommend this product to anyone.|Jake|July 5, 2010
low price with a high quality,it's a pretty good for office work or entertainment, but for CS or WOW sort of things, forget about it, it's not accurate enough|Chris|June 28, 2010
I bought this mouse for $20 at walmart for my hp laptop and it works amazingly even better than the wired mouse i had to use before i bought it...Plus a 3 year warrenty i love it <3|Laurabrianne|June 25, 2010
This is my first purchase on Logitech wireless mouse. I had some Logitech mouse, which I use it with my desktop.Quality: Think quality, think Logitech. No doubt.Features: Not much, jut a simple yet reliable wireless mouse. No customizable buttons means that just like the other wired USB/PS2 mouse.Performance: Performance is very good I think, I can even use this mouse on wavy surface such as my bedcover without any problems.Ease of use: very-very easy, just plug and play.Ergonomics: Quite good, but not as good as M305.|leonardzzz|June 11, 2010
Works like a charm out of the box on my I-Mac and Toshiba laptop. Is it possible to purchase the receiver by itself so I can keep one plugged into both computers and use the single mouse?|goatsage|June 8, 2010
picked this bad-boy up for $20 at wal-mart. This thing has been dropped on the ground a couple of times and the thing still works...works as if it were attached to the computer with a wire.tested this puppy on linux and windows and works like a charmno complaints just a great product so far|Chicken|May 31, 2010
Not big on features, just a straight forward travel mouse, which is just what I was looking for. Unsure why there are claims of the battery cover being difficult, push one button on the bottom and the cover on the top pops open, no sliding, squeezing, or other combos needed. Like the internal storage for the receiver.|SoonerT|May 26, 2010
just bought it. kinda difficult to get to the battery compartment. dont remove the hub from your computer otherwise i had to reboot my laptop. otherwise it works nice|ddub|May 3, 2010
Its a good size. It works fine. However, the texture and the quality of the plastic are not nearly as nice as my old logitech mouse which came free with my old computer. It is also very difficult to replace the battery in my new mouse. I still prefer logitech for mice.|tron|April 27, 2010
