I use this keyboard for my laptop that's connected to my TV. For 29 bucks, you can't beat it. It lacks some "special features" but who uses them anyways?Connected in seconds w/Vista. Stays connected from about 15 feet away with no problems what-so-ever.It is super light, and has relatively low profile keys. If you need a simple, clean keyboard, and don't need the extra features, this is the one to buy.|Boo-urns|July 27, 2010
