I was weaned on the IBM Model M and have preferred that or similar "crunchy" keyboards to either the mushy "quiet" 'boards of today or laptop keyboards, so be forewarned: if you too prefer a "classic"-type 'board, this one may not be for you. Point your lust and money toward a DAS Keyboard instead.As most of the reviewers out here agree, this may be the most beautiful keyboard you'll ever use, without including the truly esoteric and outrageously expensive. I fear that fact may be what influenced many of the rave overall reviews. Personally, were this keyboard not so beautiful I might have given up the day I unpacked it and plugged back in one of my trusty old IBMs. (My wife's suggestion was if it doesn't work out, I can use it on our server, where it can still be pretty but not often used. What a gal.)I've given it a couple of weeks of use and have gotten used to it, but I'm not sure if "getting used to it" is anything close to "really love typing on it." You can get used to driving a Maserati, and like it for the looks, speed, babe magnetism, etc., but that doesn't make it an easy car to drive.One BIG plus in my book that has been mentioned elsewhere but bears repeating, for anyone else who dares to step off the Redmond path, this thing plugged right in and worked from the start with Linux (Ubuntu 10.04).Also mentioned elsewhere and with which I agree, the elevating feet do not bring it up to a high enough angle - and they look pretty tender.I would suggest to anyone who doesn't love typing on a laptop to try and find a copy of this thing to take for a test drive before taking a chance on ordering it online.I do love it, but not yet for all the right reasons. I keep hoping. Because it sure is pretty.|The Misanthrope|September 19, 2010
Super easy to use and to set up. The illuminating feature is great because you can see this keyboard easily in a dim room. Comfortable to use. Alerts when "Caps" (Capital letters) are On or Caps Off. This feature is helpful.USB cord is long enough to reach the tower. I believe this is the best keyboard I have ever used in my 15 years using computers!|1PUTERGEEK1776|September 17, 2010
From a person who searches for minimalistic things, there are countless products that constitutes as minimalistic design. For this keyboard, as its' debut made its' way a long while in the past—there's still a spark of true simplicity and modernized elegance.The keyboard in itself is durable, quite heavier than it looks. The weight is still light, but gives the overall structure a reliable feel. The design is minimalistic in all respects, with the low, laptop-feel keys, along with the structured placement of each key. The aesthetics are truly inspirational for they clear ones mind when you're fingers are in flight of text.Though the design isn't ergonomic, it boasts a natural feel of your wrists, which isn't bothersome for long periods of type. There are adjustable legs, but they don't provide as much leverage for those who require keyboards high in the air. Just as it is, flat on my glass desk does great for my wrists, fingers, and palms.Each key is uniformly lit from the provided light below. The three settings provide much more customization than if it had one, so different times in the day/night shouldn't be a problem. I can only be grateful for the rarity on how much times I hit the delete button. Now that I can see, I can be more efficient when working late in the night.Logitech's PerfectStroke key system is legit, providing ultrafast key response, and minimal noise level when typing. Logitech's new key system is great technology in their products, so it should be appreciated that the company would take the time out to research something that isn't a necessity, but done so to provide an even greater experience.Although the keyboard connects with a USB port, I've noticed that the keyboard at times, will lag, causing the type you make on the keyboard, lag with the display of characters on the monitor. Perhaps upgraded software will fix this small glitch, but all in all, this is a well rounded product. Please remember that these glitches are highly rare. Compared to wireless keyboards, this is completely minute. Lags happen everywhere, you can only minimize it as best as you can.It's in my best interest that I would recommend this product to others, for those who are looking for minimalistic design, a unique experience and durability.|Navir|September 16, 2010
This is a terrific keyboard. Elegant, with a minimalist design & free from clutter, this product doesn't try to be more than it is. There are no gimmicks or buttons you'll never use, either. Perhaps a minor plus, the back-lighting feature has its own dedicated key -- no Alt+something or color-coded Fcn key necessary.You can select three levels of dimming -- from pronounced & crisp white at high to faint at low (or gone, of course) depending on your taste. There's very little inter-key light "bleeding" as well, Logitech does a good job of containing light within the characters' outlines.The feel is different at first but soon becomes a strong advantage. One small negative (caveat, really) -- if you loose a key it's VERY difficult to replace (unlike with standard keyboard keys). It will take some major patience & skill to get the "Enter" or "space bar" key back on.|JoMo|September 9, 2010
Picked one up a couple days ago at an office supply retailer. A client of mine had one and I really liked the look and feel of this keyboard. Im a Ubuntu LINUX user and didnt bother reading any manuals (as t they are always for Windoze). At any rate, out of the box the function keys all work (to my astonishment)!I rep[laced an "inexpensive" keyboard and am happy with the upgrade. Logitech should really embrace LINUX with their product suite - they have come a long way and this is yet another example where they are missing it in marketing however...Bottom line, Im heading back for a few more of these. I tend to work late at night, this thing is great for seeing what Im doing (and now my wife and kids all want one too).|/dev/null|August 27, 2010
PROS: I really like the look, feel, and just about everything about this keyboard. The illumination is good, the laptop like feel is good, and for me the lay out of the keyboard is good.CONS: This keyboard will not resume from sleep mode. I have to physically unplug the USB cable and plug it back in, in order to get this keyboard to work when resuming from sleep mode. It will work if you reboot, but for me that defeats the purpose of sleep mode. I tried everything tech support could think of and there was no solution. There is no sleep button on the keyboard you have to use your OS. I really wanted to like this keyboard, but with the sleep mode issue, I have to give it 2 stars overall. I would've returned this keyboard but I misplaced the packaging. If you use sleep mode, I would not recommend this keyboard.I own numerous Logitech products and I haven't had any problems with them until I got this keyboard. Now that I have this keyboard I am seeing other posts from people who are experiencing the same problem. Logitech should do more hands on testing before releasing products with flaws to the public; it’s just bad for business.|hajji|August 22, 2010
I have the illuminated keyboard now for around 2 weeks and so far I love it. The keys are soft and silently. The only key that makes abit of noise is the space bar. But it doesn't bother. The lights are a pretty cool feature and it looks beautifully at night. I use a logitech mouse as well which I am very satisfied with. Logitech brands are good quality and trustableTnx for this great product :)|jb|August 20, 2010
This is a great keyboard. It is elegantly designed and with features that I truly love. The back-light illumination is so awesome, and the short keystroke to type has made me a faster typer, it is much more comfortable and quiet to type on than any keyboard I have used before. I love the simple built in hand-rest too. Everything on this keyboard is understated and well designed. I do wish Logitech made a MAC version, because this is far superior to what Apple currently makes. I highly recommend this keyboard and think it is totally worth 80 dollars.|unjx|August 19, 2010
I have only been using this keyboard a week now and it has been great. I like the back-lighting and it feels just like a laptop keyboard. I would have given it a 5 star rating if the 'FN' keys were a separate row instead of doubled up.I was a little concerned about trying this keyboard since I use a Dell but decided to try it out - worst case would be having to return it. I was pleasantly surprised when this keyboard worked perfectly out of the box (including accessing the bios during boot up) without even installing the software!My system:3 year old Dell XPS 710 w/ Intel Core 2 Extreme QX6700 cpuBIOS (as purchased, never updated), version 1.1.0, dated 12/07/06Windows 7 Ultimate, 64 bit|Necrius|August 17, 2010
Excellent keyboard, the soft keys. It has the laptop keyboard feel. Nice, with a lot of features, my favorite the volume buttons and of course the lights. I do alot of computing during the night so I can turn off my desk lamp without missing a beat.I wanted to get the DiNovo but cost was a deciding factor, but I don't think I lost anything with this choice, both keyboards has the same feel.|Ragmack|August 15, 2010
During the course of my life, I've owned and used scores of keyboards; Some very nice, and some, not so much. None compare with this.After using this keyboard for a couple years, I am completely spoiled. If anything happened to it, I'd HAVE to run out and get another.The illumination feature is indispensable. It's sleek, classy, quiet and extremely handsome.If you've just spent several grand on a new computer, it's not complete without this.If your computer is old and beat up, breathe new life into it with one of these.I've recommended this to many, many people (Logitech should pay me a commission) and the verdict is always the same: This is one outstanding keyboard!|Jadfish|July 30, 2010
I'm a legal secretary and office manager of a small law firm and type a lot. This keyboard has the best touch of any keyboard I've ever used. It's quiet, but the tactile feedback is superb. My fingers fly on this keyboard! The built-in wrist rest at the bottom is also fantastic, as are the programmable function keys. I'm sure the illuminated keys are great if you type in the dark, but I won't be using that feature as I use the keyboard at work in the daytime.I'm just sorry I didn't get this keyboard a long time ago. Highly recommend.|wren7|July 27, 2010
In most games you use SHIFT for RUN, W for FORWARD, SPACE for JUMP.This combination does not work with my Logitech illuminated. I have to return it. Not for players!!!!!!!|Doodec|July 24, 2010
I work in low light (media production) and I've tried EVERY so-called illuminated keyboard. This is the best! And yes, the keystrokes (as advertised) feel good. The ONLY thing is, I wish it had a USB port on in for my Logitec Mouse!-FM|Fred_M|July 8, 2010
I became very angry with my HP wireless keyboard for not communicating with my computer, i.e. missing characters!!!! I had to keep double checking my work to make sure that it was correct. This keyboard is great! I didn't want to go back to a wired keyboard but that was all in my mind as I don't walk around the house typing anyway LOL. The keyboard looks great and is fun to use. The illuminated keys are super, why did I wait so long to buy this keyboard. I spent years trying to type in the dark....WHY!!!|Jack L|June 29, 2010
Bought this at the firing line at the office supply store, unsure.It's really an excellent product! Whoever designed this thing I thank you.|robert|June 26, 2010
Delicate, smooth, and sensitive to touch. The Logitech keybaord is very quite during typing--no sound at all. The keys respond fast to each stroke. So, be careful if you are a beginner in typing. I hope Logitech keeps making this keyboard.|FRYE|June 26, 2010
An excellent choice for those who hanker for a keyboard provided with large and quiet keys, in addition to the background light for the characters to be visible in dark places. Quality and design will satisfy even the most demanding ones, while the users are able to save energy light and noise at home during night. Works fine with Windows 7 drivers and usb port supplies the 3 different grades of light. I could tell a lot more about the difference the illuminated characters make in comparison with my old keyboard.|anasthod|June 23, 2010
Enjoyed every bit, this keyboard was the best one i have had. The slim design and illuminated keys helped me in not only saving space on the desk but also not needing to leave my room light on. Good job Logitech!|Marvin|June 17, 2010
When using an application on the whole screen, it should be interesting to have a "day/hour" window on the keyboard to let know current time.Additionnal feature: use this clock to implement a "parent timer control" in the keyboard using a password.An other improvement should be to better seperate "return/Line feed" touch from "suppr" touch.|Jean-Luc|June 14, 2010
