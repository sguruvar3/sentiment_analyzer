Features:1000dpi laser sensor.2.4GHz 125 reports/second unifying wireless technology3-year battery lifeDual mode scroll/tilt wheelBack/forward buttonsStealth thumb buttonSculpted right-hand design with rubber gripsSlick Teflon feetThe Logitech M705 cordless laser mouse is truly an innovation. It boasts a three-year battery life without compromising performance. The mouse is loaded with features ranging from a dual-mode scroll wheel to a stealth thumb button.---Performance---The tracking of the mouse is superb. Compared to an optical mouse the tracking is extremely smooth. The only problem that I found is that if you move the mouse at a very fast speed, the mouse will not track properly. Overall it is a large step up from optical mice.Logitech has really done a great job with the unifying receiver. I have used it for over a month with no lag or dropouts whatsoever. The receiver is very compact and can be stored in the mouse when not in use.The buttons of the mouse are very responsive. The clicking almost happens the instant I click on the buttons. The scroll wheel works superbly; the click-to-click mode is very precise while the freespin mode is very slick and fast-scrolling.---Features---I never believed that a mouse could run on a pair of AA batteries for 3 years. I was wrong. After owning this mouse for a month (around 2 hours a day), The battery level is at 1079/1095 days (Battery: AA Energizer Ultimate Lithium). That’s about 4000 hours of battery life! Extremely outstanding for a high-performance mouse!One thing that sets Logitech mice apart from other manufacturers is the dual mode scroll wheel. It has 2 modes: click-to-click scrolling and freespin mode. The click-to-click mode is very precise and useful for games (weapon selection), short web pages, and if you can't handle the very fast movements of the freespin mode (like me). The freespin mode is extremely fast and slick (sometimes too slick). It is useful mostly for very long pages and documents. The freespin mode is not perfect though, it sometimes jumps around your page because it's too sensitive. I myself prefer the click-to-click mode.The stealth thumb button is a excellent touch. It lets you bind useful commands to specific programs without sacrificing some of the basic buttons. The mouse is very versatile. It lets you bind different actions to 6 of the buttons in the mouse. You can also make some buttons have a different effect in specific programs.The slick Teflon feet are amazing. They do an amazing job of reducing friction so the mouse can glide more easily. The only problem, however, is that they are not very durable. They wear out very quickly. After my first day of using the mouse I already noticed minimal wear marks on the mouse. this is a problem as I can't seem to find replacement mouse feet. I hope that I don't end up replacing the mouse every so often just because of worn feet.---Quality---The mouse seems to be made of very sturdy hard plastic. I have owned this mouse for more than a month and have had no major problems with it whatsoever. The only gripe that I have are the feet. While I understand that they use Teflon for the feet to make it glide smoother, the Teflon feet wear out too quickly! And I also can't find where I can get replacement feet for the mouse. The buttons, scroll wheel, and the rubber grips all feel very strong and long-lasting.---Ergonomics---The mouse feels like a dream, it's very comfortable to use. The sculpted right-hand shape supports your hand perfectly. The rubber grips on the side are very comfortable and they keep your hand from getting tired from gripping the mouse. I can use this mouse for hours and my hand is still in tip shape; no signs of tiredness or fatigue.---Ease of use---It's very easy to set up, just plug it in, wait a few seconds, and it's ready to use! No drivers to download, just plug it in. The features are limited though if you don't install the SetPoint software. The SetPoint software can be installed either from the included disc (although it's an old version of the software), or download the latest version from the net.Good+ Great quality+ Battery lasts very long+ Unifying receiver+ Fantastic scroll wheel+ Extra thumb button+ Slick Teflon feet+ Very comfortableBad- Teflon feet wear out quickly- Buttons are not that customizable- Off-centered laser- No dpi settings- Cannot handle very fast movementsConclusionThis mouse is great. It's packed with lots of features that will be sure to impress anyone. I can recommend this to anyone looking for a wireless laser mouse.|matthew u|August 12, 2010
Forget my review of the M305 mouse - this one is the ultimate one!!|Austie|July 15, 2010
I think this is the best mouse ever. All of the Logitech products means quality.|bilgeaydos|May 24, 2010
I have been using this mouse since it came out and many hours per day and I have not had any problems with it lagging or the batteries dying out. It is still going even after about 20 Windows installations that took 6 - 8 hours a piece. This is a great mouse.One bad point about the mouse only. The rubber padding located near the Set Point button on the bottom wears unevenly in comparison to the remaining areas of the padding. It could wear all the the way through eventually but for now it just looks smudged and indented from use in a small area, whereas the rest of the padding is pristine. An anomoly of this mouse presumably.|Larry|May 22, 2010
This was purchased to replace the touchpad on my laptop, I never liked touchpads but I love this mouse. It's small and comfortable to use and packs a ton of features. The stubby usb conection is great, no worries about snaging it on stuff, put it in and forget it. If I am writing papers, surfing the web, or doing just about anything else this mouse makes it possible to do anything I need except type. The programable buttons can be set to do just about anything and are almost perfectly located. The only drawback is the thumb button, the motion to activate is down, it has taken some getting used to. A more natural movement would be to push in, but only a minor blemish on a product that I wish I had for all my computers. It's wonderfully small, it fits nicely in my backpack, but still big enough to fit in my hand and not be bulky.|Freaky1|April 21, 2010
When I started shopping for a mouse for my MacBook Pro to use in desktop mode, my final choices were Logitech Marathon M705 and Apple Magic mouse.First I went to play with Apple magic mouse but I didn't like overall feel in hand and small multitouch surface comparing to my MBP trackpad. Plus after reading numerous reviews, complaining about battery life I decided to go with Logitech.Things I like about this mouse:- Functionality, Mouse has a number of buttons that I can assign according to my preference. It gives me most functions that I need working on my mac i.e. left/right click, back/forward button for browsing, horizontal/vertical scrolling. (Hyperscroll is a nice function to scroll through long documents).- Battery life, 3 years is rare enough for me to actually flip the mouse and change batteries.- Unifying receiver is so tiny and fits nicely in my Apple Aluminum KB. It truly is plug and forget.- works on glass although battery life may be impaired- This mouse was definitely made with MAC in mind I am so happy that logitech devoted time to make this mouse work with mac, software has rich list of adjustmentsFinally I would like to mention the form. Although it is a little small for my palm, mouse's body still repeats all palm curves nicely. And there's a hidden button that I assigned to expose my apps.Way to go Logitech!!!|iDrive|February 13, 2010
Great mouse. I would prefer VX revolution though. x|Sonic|February 10, 2010
-compared with VX Revolution:Same: The shape is almost the same as VX RevolutionDifferent:1.heavier because 2 battery needed, but can run with single battery, it seems that the long life is a result of parallel connection of the two.2.The switch is on top: you lost a search button, but don’t need to turn it over3.Longer battery life(as advertised, but I didn’t test it, wow, 3year battery)4.Tiny unify receiver: which I love most. Unlike the Bluetooth receiver, you don’t need to search for device. But if you want to connect 2 or more Logitech unify mouse/keyboard, you need to fire up the Unifying connect software to setup.5.No zoom lever anymore: I really don’t like to see Logitech erase it.6.Hidden thumb press button under rubber skin: l like this little guy.7.Laser engine seems to be different, but I just haven’t notice the difference.8.Moved the LED light to front, but no battery indicators(well, 3 year battery life, you don’t really need it).Overall:The best ergonomics notebook mouse among all mice available so far (unless you are left-handed, Logitech should really make a left hand version).I upgrade it mostly because the tiny receiver and fast scrolling wheel, it looks as if the building quality is ”cheap” looking compared to VX Revolution. Logitech seems to have abandoned the SmartShift technology in MX Revolution (including the new Performance Mouse), which I think many people want it see it back. Runs prefect in all materials except glass.|mradw|January 30, 2010
