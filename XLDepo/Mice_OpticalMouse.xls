I've been a longtime Logitech mouse fan and user. This mouse is completely different from previous Logitech mice I've used. It has a built-in nonlinear acceleration that makes it really hard to use. I have both my old $15 Logitech mouse and this new one plugged in, and the difference is easily noticable.The problem is that there's a sudden threshold where the cursor starts moving very quickly. I'm a fast user, and this mouse moves too fast during quick movements and too slow during slow ones. This sort of nonlinear behavior is completely counter-intuitive from what your hand-eye coordination expects. If you're a person who's not sensitive or observant, like probably the other reviewers, then you probably won't notice.As for my software, I'm on a Dell laptop with XP and the trackpad mouse software. There's no acceleration setting in the software.The difference in behavior is kind of like webbrowser scrolling through clicking the wheel, in IE versus Firefox. With IE, after clicking the wheel, the farther the cursor is moved from the spot, the faster it scrolls, and it's horribly nonlinear and hard to predict. With Firefox, the acceleration as you move the cursor farther from the spot is constant and a breeze to use.|person|April 27, 2010
This is my second Logitech optical mouse,the first one having run out of cheese after 3 1/2 years. For the price of two packs of cigarettes I got a GREAT mouse and no shortness of breath!|bobbyceenoevil|February 6, 2010
Bought mouse to replace a older mac, keyboard mouse. box indicated was PS friendly, but did not indicate that it was 6 pin mini DIN friendly ONLY. Found this out after destroying box to get product out. luckily, it fits my other machine, which is USB friendly.Like the device.|CLH|December 3, 2009
(FYI I purchased the optical mouse without the smooth top)I just bought the black USB optical mouse. It is everything I want and need. The cord length is generous. And, because it is corded, the performance is reliable and greater than a wireless mouse. Additionally, because it is corded it does not require batteries.I gave the quality three stars because, honestly, respective to other mice, it is not as high quality "feeling" or looking. However when it comes down to it, it's just your basic $10 dollar mouse.Yet... when I think of other people who do not have access to computers or the internet, why am I complaining?However, I am happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others.|Hot D|November 5, 2009

Great product for a great price. This is our 2nd identical mouse. Had to replace the 1st one after 3 or 4 years...can't beat that!|bjm|March 5, 2009
Nice mouse, price was great! This replaced my old MS mouse and I must say this is the best mouse I have had. It's light weight and very easy to use. A great mouse for the money.|Sugar54|February 28, 2009
For only $15 this mouse is amazing. I used this mouse for over a year before upgrading to the logitech G5. Of course the G5 will stomp this into the ground, but your paying for that. The quality of this mouse if outstanding and wont let you down. Great for games to txt documents.|Squib7|February 17, 2009
