I have had this keyboard about two months, and am very impressed with it's features. But--- Everyonce-in-a-while it just stops responding, and has to be reset.I have tried changing the reciever to a different usb port, but this does not seem to make any difference. I have also shut down all rf transmitters in the area, but to no avail.I have other "LOGITECH" wireless devices, and they all perform flawlessly.Go Figure!!Maybe I just got a lemon! But I am still not giving up.I still would recommend "LOGITECH" products to a friend or client.|ACE CONDOR|July 22, 2010
I own the wired version and wireless for work, prior model before the unifying receiver and battery indicator.This is by far the best programmer keyboard I've ever owned.Pros:- Large Delete key ( other programmers know what I'm taking about )- Programmable keys, for those common tasks or scripts.- Wave design takes a few days, but then you can't see yourself using a normal keyboard afterward.- Great battery life, I've changed the batteries once in 3 years and I type all day every day.- Easily cleanable, split several drinks on my home one, just pop off the keys clean and replace, it's that easy.|programmer01|April 1, 2010
The K350, what can I say, no problems with keys. This keyboard has reached the top, no software problems and works just fine, the only issue is that unifying software should be made with older products, otherwise this is a great product, not only works great on my PC but plug it into the Nintendo Wii and works there too.|Big Cat|March 26, 2010
I have tryed to use this with my doking station and laptop. Looks great feels better, but completely unreliable. Keys constantly skipping, repeating non stop, I have uninstalled and reinstalled software dozens of times but to no avail. I have moved the "antenna" to the closest port and moved the keyboard rightg next to it no luck. I am now on my trird and I think I have to go back to corded, but the wave. The keyboard itself is great, I love the layout and the hot heys (when they work) are excellent.|jim|March 17, 2010
After I upgraded my mouse to the Performance MX I decided to look for a keyboard, this one is just great took a couple of days to get use to the “wave” design but after that I can’t use another keyboard, I love the padded cushion which make the keyboard very comfortable. It works with my mouse tiny receiver and I haven’t had any problems so far. The only bad thing are the media buttons, they look and feel cheap compared to the actual keys which are soft and nice.This is an awesome keyboard.|d3mon|March 5, 2010
I agree with the other reviews i.e. the wireless keyboard MK350 is great design, and plays well with the unifying system mice too. My only admonition to Logitech, as I sent them this advice, is to indicate to buyers they SHOULD download the latest software and run it in order to reliably connect/recognize the devices. My included disks simply did not work to get my items recognized. But the Support site is great and easy to work with. Once I downloaded the software latest version and ran it, my keyboard and mice instantly were recognized. We are enjoying the great design.|robert hh|February 25, 2010
This keyboard is a little funky to use at first if you are used to the standard non wave ones but it's not as extreme as some others. The buttons are very soft and comforting. The added rubber padding is a big plus as well. The overall quality is very nice. I don't really care about the extra buttons. Worth the purchase definitely.|c1rcu1tn3rd|February 21, 2010
I have been a loyal customer of Logitech for years and there have been great products and some bad ones (at least in my use), but this keyboard practically sells itself. I needed a replacement wireless keyboard for my computer as my previous one from Logitech was no longer supported by Logitech and it's function buttons did not work in Windows 7.This keyboard had everything my previous one had as far programable buttons along with my media control options. It also has the ability to open any of your CD/DVD drives at a push of a button! The best option on this keyboard (for me anyway) was the on/off switch! No more blowing through cases of batteries every year.This keyboard is also a lot lighter than any other Logitech keyboard I've owned. It looks flimsy in the picture, but it's a solid keyboard. If you want functionality at a decent price then get this keyboard! It's totally worth it.|Sovereignty|January 26, 2010
