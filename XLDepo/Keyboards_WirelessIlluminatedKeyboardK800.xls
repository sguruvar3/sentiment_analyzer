This keyboard is a great keyboard for someone that often gets wires all tangled up in a mess. For myself, I type while leaning in my chair with my feet up on a foot rest, and the keyboard sits in my lap. For users like myself, this keyboard is perfect.Pros:-Wireless-Illumination is bright when needed-Good battery life-Lightweight-Really easy to use-Great feel when typing-Can type while charging-Proximity activated back lightingCons-Fairly high priced for a non-gaming keyboard-Proximity sensor could be a bit more sensitive-Needs to eventually be plugged in (why can't batteries last forever?)Overall this is a great keyboard. I am very pleased with the battery life (at least 3 days of heavy use per charge, haven't drained it down to nothing yet though.) The illumination is just as bright as the Illuminated keyboard (I also have 2 of those) so I am very pleased with this product.If you are in the market for a wireless keyboard, this is a great solution.|Nemock|September 16, 2010
