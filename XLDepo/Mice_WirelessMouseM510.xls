I bought it to use at home with my LT on my desk or around the house so full size was attractive for me. But form day one there was no coordiantion between the mouse and cursor movemnt/speed. I tried all kind of surfaces over 8 weeks. SW down load and adjsuting speed through it helped a little, but still no smooth movements. I will often use my good old MS mouse when frustrated with it but will try it again next day on another kind of surface! and then it stopped working at all when I was going to put it on eBay for 1 cent + shipping cost!|Rana|September 7, 2010
I bought it on sale to replace my old Logitech LX-7 mouse which had started to act up, even with new batteries. The forward/back buttons are in a much more logical place, on the LX-7 they were behind the scoll wheel. The only minus that I've found with the M510 mouse is that it's a little small for my grip. Otherwise it's a great mouse.|Rich|August 7, 2010
I bought the M510 as a replacement for my ailing MX1000 which had finally given up the ghost. This mouse is accurate for me relative to the old MX1000. I do miss the page up/down buttons in front of and behind the roller ball, as well as the programmable thumb button behind the up/down buttons. Overall, I'm happy, and for the price I feel I got a good mouse.FYI - my desk is wooden and relatively non-reflective. I can't speak to how it would work on a glass desktop or other reflective surfaces.|Mudbug|August 5, 2010
Love this mouse. The precision is the first thing you notice. Once you dial it in to your preferences it's great. I won't ever go back to an optical mouse again.|RAC|August 4, 2010
This mouse has awfull precision. Cursor jumps all over the screen. Different speeds in X and Y directions. Very difficult to control. I had to switch to my old optical mouse RX250 which works great. What a waste of money.|spetkov|August 3, 2010
