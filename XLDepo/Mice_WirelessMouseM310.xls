Purchased this mouse on 09/10/2010 from Beast Buy and compared to my former LogiTech mouse this is a transition that I had never expected.. You got rid of the olde, "trap door" two battery compartment cover replacing it with a more sturdy "sliding door" battery compartment cover in addition to eliminating one battery. It is a much more "sturdy" design and as a result is a compliment to the LogiTech engineering group for development of a quality product. Altho I am and "olde Guy" I am computer literate enogh to judge quality improvement when I see and/or buy it.|Yellowbird|September 13, 2010
I've had this mouse for a few weeks now and so far I love it!! Installation was SO easy - even a child could do it. The way it fits in my hand is very comfortable, even after extended use. It has great battery life and I like the stubby USB connector - I don't have to worry about hitting it if I move my computer and damaging the USB ports. Installing the additional software from the website was a breeze too. Overall mouse appears great value for money.|tee4too|August 11, 2010
I own a M310 and one of the great selling features that I didn't even realize when I purchased it is it's Unifying capabilities that I found out about when I recently purchased a K340 keyboard. Both the mouse and keyboard will use the same receiver.The mouse itself is smooth, and fits in the palm of the hand nicely. For a wireless mouse (I've owned several both MS and Logitech) they don't get much better.I only gave it 4 stars for features as it doesn't have 2 extra side buttons a lot of other mice have. (which I don't really care for anyway)I highly recommend this mouse.|Joseph|June 25, 2010
I don't own the m310, but I hope they have improved the quality over the m305 which I do own and review here. After using the m305 for about 9 months the left click button began to malfunction. Among other problems, it wouldn't click and drag. Soon the right click button began to do the same. I was pretty disgusted with the thing, but I called customer support and they were helpful. After guiding me through a couple tests they sent me a replacement. A receipt was not required, which was lucky since I no longer had one. It's been a couple weeks and the replacement works well so far. As long as the thing works, I'm happy with the mouse. Logitech customer support was all I could ask for.|badakbuddy|June 24, 2010
