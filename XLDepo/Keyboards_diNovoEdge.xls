It's about time keyboard manufacturers get the 10-key off the keyboard! The biggest complaint I have about keyboards is their size, especially the width. If you want a 10-key then buy a 10-key. The rest of us don't use or need it!|bob|June 30, 2010
I have gotten terrible pains in the past from working at my desk using the mouse and keyboard, and finally my last employer bought very adjustable furniture where the part of the desk with my keyboard would lower below the rest of the desk - basically down to the top of my knees. That helped considerably with the pain which was to the inside of my right shoulder blade near the top of the shoulder blade.After I quit working for a while, the pain went away, and while doing contract work on my laptop at home, I noticed the pain did not start back.When I started with a new employer I thought I might have to buy the same sort of adjustable furniture, but no! This was the answer! I work with this sitting on my knees and my back doesn't hurt at all and sometimes I work 11 or 12 hour days.I also have to say that the button on the left, which is another left mouse button is INVALUABLE. I would not be near as efficient if I was continually having to move my right hand to the mouse key. I am very, very, very happy and pain free with this keyboard! It is responsive and just completely awesome!|ADC|June 29, 2010
This keyboard the logitech, performance mouse MX, and an updated wireless desktop mic to go with it all match this keyboard|Scavengeriot|June 4, 2010
I concur with deVos on every point save the Unified thing. The flagship ought to be a Bluetooth design.It's ridiculous to revert back to a non-Bluetooth design. Bluetooth's here for exactly this sort of thing, and I'll be damned if smartphones or tablets of tomorrow will have a USB port for connecting a keyboard.Secondly, I'd assume that we can't expect Logitech to divulge if they happen to stumble upon a fault in their cryptographic protocol, right? You know -- like you'd expect if there's a fault in a standardized protocol?So Logitech, keep producing a high-end Bluetooth keyboard/mouse combo! If you want additional user-friendlyness, do like Apple does, on top of Bluetooth -- but don't replace it!|That's Dr. Anonymous to you|May 28, 2010
I have been using this keyboard for over two years now. It's pricy, but totally worth it. Awesome design, great ease of use.Only regret I have is that it's such a pity that Logitech hasn't upgraded this flagship with a new one that uses the unifying nano receiver (oh, and a matching new unified media pad for that matter).Please Logitech, give your fans what they want! The burning sensation of the money in my pocket is becoming unbearable :)!|deVos|May 15, 2010
Pros:Great design. Slim, compact, light.Battery lasts long and good reception from 10mAll the right keys, nothing missing.Cons:Battery problem. after some time stopped recharging (known problem). Had to order a spare battery through eBay and replace it.Impossible to clean. no screws, all glued elements.|Gilad|May 12, 2010
I recently wrote a bad experience I had with my Dinov Edge- Micheal from CSR told me that my product was under warranty which I did not even know "What an Idiot I was" Anyways, during these tough economic times it's nice to know that a company "logitech" has great customer support and has people that understand the market situation and they don't give the dry I don't care coporate answer! I will buy more and more logitech due to my experience. This is a great keyboard and if something goes wrong you have guys like Michael standing behind the name "Logitech"Tomio|Tomio|May 11, 2010
Just got it, key board was intact and ready to go out of the box. diNovo Edge's major keys layout (Home, End, Page Up, Page Down and Delete) was typical of Logitech, but I'm not complaining. However I'm going to miss that number pad, I must have been one of the few using it. But then again it was redundant to have more than one set of number keys anyway.Pros: Easy setup, beep when caps lock is pressed (I usually have problems accidentally pressing caps lock when typing lol) Media key can be programed to open any program you want, it doesn't have to be Media Center. The keyboard is as solid as the other key boards I've used before. Light up display when Fn key is pressed to show hidden keysCons: Touch pad is in an awkward spot and is hard to get used to. Scroll feature on the touch pad is hard to use. Plexiglas finish gets finger prints easily. Cost was also a little high, however, how many keyboards out there do you know of that can replace or supplement a mouse.|Satisfied|April 29, 2010
I have worked with a DiNovo Edge for more than a year. On the plus side, it has a good touch for someone who types a lot, and it's loaded with all kinds of buttons and features.On the negative side, I have purchased one DiNovo but now am on my third keyboard. One suffered from almost zero battery life and was replaced. The most-used letters quickly wore off of the second one; it too was replaced. I'm now on No. 3, out of warranty on the initial purchase, and the letters are wearing off of this one, too. There is no 'L' anymore, and almost no E or S. The keys are there, but what they are has worn off.So if you type a lot, expect the keyboard to wear away faster than others you might have used.One last negative. The keyboard shows every speck of dirt and becomes grimy very quickly. Yes, you certainly can buff it back to its original classy shine, but I'm among those people who have enough to do without also frequently cleaning the keyboard.|Readmore|April 21, 2010
Without a doubt the best typing feel of any keyboard I've owned in the last 15 years. Really nice key action and the other buttons feel solid as well. Great layout on the mac version, and as a home theatre keyboard, it's superb. Looks great, but can smudge easily--keep a microfiber cloth handy and you're good to go.The touchdisc scrolling is a little strange to get used to, but it beats having to keep a mouse around your living room.Every other keyboard feels inferior to me after using this one.|Kyodai|March 20, 2010
I just received my new diNovo Edge. As soon as I started typing, the keypad on the v key popped off. That is such a shocking lack of quality control that I've lost confidence in the whole device.|legal9ball|February 25, 2010
This keyboard is amazing. I purchased the Mac edition for when i hook my MacBook Pro up to my HDTV. The keyboard is well laid out. Far superior typing feel and comfort to anything Apple has put out. I do not know if Logitech is discontinuing this keyboard for Mac. If so, buy it while you still can. Last I saw the Apple Store online still had it at 180 bucks. But I purchased mine from macmall.com for only 80 bucks! Deals are out there. So worth it, especially compared to Apple's uncomfortable little bluetooth keyboard which is close to that price. The only reason I docked 1 star off of the performance is due to the mouse track pad. The sensitivity is poor and scrolling using the touch pad is difficult. I normally use a separate mouse anyway, so it's sufficient for minor tasks and very handy when using the keyboard on my lap. I allowed my friend, who is an IT specialist, to use the keyboard. He was so impressed he went out to get one. He is a PC user and says it is the best he has come across as well.|Dex4|February 16, 2010
THis key has a very sleek design. It responds very well. The glossy finish is incredible in front of any mac or pc.. The touch disk is good for when you are using it with a multimedia computer and good foor putting on your lap. it is very skinny and there are extra buttons for everything including mail music|Adari|December 25, 2009
A have tried 6 keyboards in the past year including all of the apple keyboards. This is the nicest one out there. As close to perfect as you can get. My only gripes... (1) the mouse pad on the bottom right is worthless. (2) Wish they would up date their drivers to better support Snow Leapord.|Tex Austin|September 11, 2009
I wish I found this years ago - I would have purchased one and enjoyed it over the years!1. The nearly useless number keypad on the right side of most "regular" keyboards is gone. Thank goodness; a regular user should buy one separately since that would surely be more convenient! This configuration is better - I purchased "separate" keyboards a long time ago since I hardly ever need the number keyboard.2. The on-off switch could be a little bigger plus with a clearly visible sign for on-off; now it is a guessing game.3. I always, always have a subdued lighting environment when I use my computer. That is good for eyesight! I wish this keyboard came with a "lighted keyboard" version - or at least with a built-in "lighted keyboard mode" to switch on when desired. Battery consumption is not as critical a concern as are: (a) ease of use [i.e., for the eyes]; [b] user-friendly comfort; and [c] yes, even aesthetics! Batteries can be replaced at minimal cost.5. Logitech should publish instructions on exactly how the diNovo's battery can/should be replaced - and with what type of battery.6. I agree with some who suggest that the mouse buttons should be replicated on the left side of the keyboard; the right mouse-button replica at present is most welcome - but replicating both left and right buttons would be much better.7. The diNovo Edge should be offered for sale with a perfectly matched mouse - instead of leaving one to choose from many available models. Anyone wishing to opt for a different mouse may still do so. I certainly would have purchased this keyboard even if the "packaged but excellent, matching mouse" would mean higher cost.8. The diNovo Edge as presently designed is very, very nearly ideal. Grade is 95% or A minus. This product is excellent, period.9. CONGRATULATIONS TO LOGITECH!10. When a better/upgraded model of the diNovo Edge is available, please let me know.|Pete|September 8, 2009
Good: light, long range, combined with a responsive touchpad, keys feel good, exactly what you need for Windows media center PC.Bad:1) they made the same mistake as Microsoft in one of their keyboards, modifying conventional layout of Delete, Home, End, etc. keys. Even after 6 months of use, I still frequently tap on Delete key when I want End. Every fast typing user will have big problems with this. Layout of major keys should not be modified.2) mouse keys location is very inconvenient. Try pushing a mouse key and using touchpad at the same time. They should have duplicated mouse keys on the left side of the keyboard.3) touchpad scrolling action is only marginally more convenient than common touchpads. Why are they still using this iferior technical solution? What can be easier than making a clickable scrolling outer ring around touchpad, like they do it on digital cameras. One dollar more expensive - infinitely more usable.4) positioning of the keyboard on the stand could have been done better.5) price tag is very high, which is probably due to its novelty and lack of competition. Adding bluetooth to a keyboard adds $20 max, its reasonable market price shouldn't be no more than $80.|G21|August 26, 2009
THE BEST PRODUCT THAT LOGITECH EVER MADEBY FARRRRRRRRRRRRRRIM A BIG FAN OF LOGITECH I HAVE MOST OF THE STUFF BUT THIS ONE IS OUT OF THIS WORLD|fred|August 24, 2009
Overall the DNV Edge is the most useful thing that ever bought for my PC. The Bluetooth connection frees my desk of cables, and the touchpad eliminates the need for a bulky mouse. Then there is the design. Thin and light, with a very professional look, the Edge is always asked about when people see it on my desk.I could rant for days about it, but in the end all I can come to for conclusions is GET ONE. You'll wonder how you ever lived without it.|JR|August 24, 2009
This is flat out the best keyboard I've ever used. The battery seems to last forever, it feels great under my fingers, and with it's slim design, my wrist are not lifted off the surface the keyboard rest on into an uncomfortable position. This makes quite a difference when you type a lot.A couple of minor nitpicks though. First, a better way to scroll using a slider like the volumn slider would be great. Second, I would like the option to light up the keys when working with it at night. Using one of the F Keys under the function format would be great to be able to turn on or turn off backlighting for all the keys (which of course would shorten battery life if used in the 'on' position all the time). Third, the Caps Lock key should be backlite when turned on (a different color or brighter if a future version is made with backlit keys). Fourth and finally, where is the matching detachable numberpad for this keyboard. I used to use complex characters which can only be made using the Alt key plus number pad keys in my passwords, thus, making them totally uncrackable to even the most roburst password cracking program, but without the feature, I've had to resort to other means and change all my passwords. If you could please produce the number pad for this keyboard, I would be first in line in the store to purchase it, as I don't want to buy another keyboard, as I really love this one a great deal.|Stumpy|July 29, 2009
This is the best keyboard that i have ever bougth. Its magnificent, the keystroking, the form, the artistic desing, all of it, i just love it. The only detail thats dosent make it a perfect keyboard is that it realy needs a ligth for the caps lock, and also, this is something that I allways ask from a keyboard, is light on the key, i mean individual light on each key. Thats all, and i highly recomend this product|Sheinlord|July 16, 2009
