I went to Office Max in Strongsville (near Cleveland) OH with the determination to find a simple, small, no frills keyboard that functions flawlessly. I did not want a bunch of buttons linking me to shopping or my volume control and taking up space. I work with computers (development, programming, training, testing, etc.), and I frequently have more than one keyboard on my desk at a time. My simple Belkin keyboard had annoyed me for too long with keys that did not function consistently. (The keys for 1, !, and left-shift usually need a second, firm pressing to function. I would look back at my Belkin keyboard work and discover 1s or !s were missing, or capitals made with left-shift were not capitalized.) My Logitech is small, quiet, and functions perfectly. The backslash is exactly where I expect it. The backspace and all keys are full sized. I love it! One feature I like on my fancy-button Logitech keyboard is the page scroller roller. But, I'm not disappointed in my K120. Now I know, look for the Logitech.|ncc9|July 30, 2010
