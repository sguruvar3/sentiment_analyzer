This is a great keyboard if you want the multimedia keys in a budget keyboard. The keys are great to use, and the keyboard looks great itself also. Only con is that it does not include a scroll lock key.|Tyler178|November 5, 2009
This is a good basic keyboard. I was looking for a low profile keyboard as i am a heavy typer and located this. I am disappointed that it isn't quiet touch keys, not sure what low profile keys means to Logitech, felt like standard keys and they do not get as loud as DELL standard key boards, but still pretty loud.The search continues!|cnet88|July 18, 2009
I came home from school one day to find that my mom had purchased this keyboard. My previous keyboard was missing keys and I badly needed a new keyboard. This keyboard fascinated me with its features, including a rotating volume dial, 12 quick access keys that allow you to open your favorite web pages, programs, files, or folders on your computer with ease, and keys that allow you to easily get to your Web search engine, mail application, browser home page, or VoIP program. I haven't had a working keyboard with this much functionality for probably six years, and I am just blown away by all the capabilities and amazing glossy appearance. The keyboard is very small and lightweight, and is very comfortable to use. The keys are very short, and the entire keyboard is a pretty quiet device to use. I am very satisfied with this keyboard and would definitely recommend it for its functionality, design and appearance, and comfort of use.|Blake|April 10, 2009
