I purchased this mouse as part of a keyboard/mouse combo and was worried it wouldn't suit me (mostly loved the keyboard.) Right out of the box it connected perfectly requiring no setup (Windows 7 Ult.) and didn't have a problem with my mousepad-less high-gloss wood desk.The feel of this mouse is spectacular. The weight makes the drag perfect. This is my first laser and I struggled with the precision at first, but found the weight helped me from running all over the screen. Had my last mouse for over a year and a half and didn't want to give it up since I love the buttons and their position. This made me forget all about it. Plus it's a good looking mouse. The silver on the scroll works perfect with the black body and green light.I didn't customize the buttons because I didn't want to load some garbage software on my computer, and I feel no less for it. Never had an issue scrolling and the 'click-less' scroll is great for working on our database when the window is a mile long.Needless to say I am very happy, and my worry was quite hollow. Of the many negative reviews a lot of them seem to be a product of user error so don't let them discourage you. Another great Logitech product.|5280Tech|August 12, 2010
I bought this MX620 with the assumption that no more mouse pad would be needed. Well, I was wrong. It states you can use this mouse on glass, but it doesn't say if it performs LOL other than that, it is a great mouse as usual with Logitech.|techie|May 16, 2010
I used this mouse for about a year without any problems. It felt great. Then all of a sudden it stopped working. Thinking it was just the battery, I replaced it. No luck, it won't work even though the light is green and I've folowed all of the instructions.|Experienced Mouser|May 1, 2010
This was a great mouse until I installed windows 7 on my laptop. Since then it double-clicks when I click once or I have to click 4-5 times before it does anything. It's very depressing cause I liked this mouse very much and I can't use it anymore. If anyone else has solved this problem, I'd appreciate some help.|Dwro8ea|April 8, 2010
It skips and doesn't detect some of the movement so i'm often killed in call of duty mw and that annoys me.Sometimes it's like it has sticky keys, i clicked the left mouse once to fire and it was shooting for 5 seconds or i clicked the left mouse more than 5 times and it did nothing so i was killed againThe scroll also acts weird, on precision scrolling it doesn't detect the scrolls equallyI've tried it on all kinds of surfaces and it always has the same problemslousy mouse ( it was a present so i'm hoping i can return it)|toni|March 22, 2010
When scroll wheel is set to "no clicks", it is uncontrolableI randomly loose connectivity & need to unplug/replug usb transmitterI now realize the scroll wheel sometime stops workingIf my life depended on this mouse, I'd be dead by now|MfU|March 20, 2010
Great mouse, the weight is perfect for easy comfortable sliding. I play First Person Shooter games, and this map suits well. I have never been a fan of Ultra High DPI. Just not my style. Great Upgrade for me, I was previously using Logitech Trackman Vista Trackball.In Steam games, the search button, which i rebinded to be my "Push-to-Talk" key in Ventrilo. But at time's it brings up my Windows Search Screen and Minimizes the game. I found that restarting the mouse, helps when it rarely happens. I've zero problems with the hyperscroll, very addicting. I've had the same batteries in this mouse since I purchased it December 10, 2009. Currently 50% battery power left, and I leave it on all the time. Great budget mouse with 8 "re-bind-able" buttons.|Cpt. Planet|February 8, 2010
This is the second one of this mouse I have purchased and although I love all the features of it: the scroll button is sturdy and is smooth, the extra programmable buttons to the left and right were highly functional for my needs, its comfortable to hold for long periods of time and the weight keeps the pointer under control, the battery life was superb, I could go a month or more without replacing them, and another 3 days in "critical". Well built and study enough to stand up to a great many spills from the kids :) However, straight from the box I always had issues with the mouse and reciever never making a decent connection and the least little thing in the way (piece a paper,a cup, a wire, anything at all!) and the mouse would lose connection and stop working, or worked randomly and intermittenly. I had to keep my harddrive in just the right position and keep my desk free of everything in order to use it. Also tried using an extention to put the reciever on the deck, a mere foot or two away from the mouse and it still didn't work, only made the problem worse. I thought maybe it was a factory error with the first and purchased another several months later but I still had the same issues. For that reason, I do not recommend this product. I learned my lesson and am moving on to something else.|mmanney0821|January 23, 2010
I have worked with many mice, not including Mickey, and this things is fantastic. Lame JOKE sorry!! The ergonomics are very nice and the feel is better than anticipated. Not going to tell you this works for everyone, but it is a quality mouse that is built for speed and precision. If you prefer lots of customzation and features in your mouse, then you may want to look elsewhere.|Brasco|January 7, 2010
I have used this mouse for about a year. The build quality is excellent, ergonomics are good, and the mouse tracks very well. Unfortunately, the scroll wheel, which is the feature that attracted me to the mouse in the first place, was rather disappointing.In its "free-scroll" mode, the scrolling is very smooth. However, the mouse wheel is over-sensitive in this mode. It is very easy to move the scroll wheel without touching it--all you have to do is move the mouse. Because of this, the page that you are reading can scroll randomly just from moving the mouse. I find this very annoying.So, I switched to the "click" mode. The problem there is, it is sometimes impossible to scroll just one "click." The scroll wheel doesn't always want to stop, and when you lift your finger, it will scroll another click or two. This means you can't always scroll to just the point that you want without keeping your finger on the scroll wheel. This, too, is very annoying.I am a big fan of Logitech products, so it pains me to say this about the mouse, but I must: this was a disappointing product, and I have now replaced the mouse (with another Logitech mouse). If Logitech were to revisit the design, I would be willing to have a look (albeit cautiously) at a future product with similar features. As it stands, while there is much to appreciate about this mouse, the wonky scrolling prevents me from recommending it.|bigfoot|January 4, 2010
Over the years I've purchased many, many and many mice from mostly Logitech and by far this is the BEST mouse I've had. I haven't had it long enough to know if the batteries will last the 9 months. But if they even last 6 months, it's worth every cent.I've paid from $25.00 to over $100.00 and this is the BEST performing mouse by far that I've ever used. I'm only telling you that "don't" spend the big bucks for a mouse that doesn't even compare to this one. I know you've heard Trust Me but Trust Me, this is the only mouse you will buy. Excellence doesn't have to cost an arm and a leg. I'm only leaving this because I have a lot to say when it's garbage so I thought I would finally write something positive for once. Thanks, Dave|djfsr1947|December 11, 2009
Pros:Nicely weightedscrolling is smoothshaped very comfortablyCons:scroll wheel too active!search button isn't usefulSo I bought this mouse because my old one broke and I figured I would get a nice new logitech laser mouse. I was very excited when i opened the packaging and played around with the mouse, but after about 15 minutes I started to get fed up. The hyperscrolling is very fun (it will continue spinning for a considerable amount of time if you flick it) but causes more trouble than it's worth. When on the smoothest setting, the wheel overreacts to mouse movements, i will be browsing a page and suddenly everything will jump 3 lines because the scrolling was set off by other gestures. It gets extremely annoying and I had to set the wheel to a more standard ticking scroll, but that makes it stupid to buy the mouse when it's main feature isn't working. Also, I haven't even used the search button during normal browsing. In the end, I'm returning this mouse because I refuse to pay for a feature that doesn't work. Maybe other models have better wheels. I'm pretty disappointed, this is the first time a logitech device hasn't worked perfectly for me.|H____|December 7, 2009
I've only had this mouse for a day and I am extremely impressed! This is the best mouse I have ever used! I had my eye on it for a while and it finally went on sale and I bought it. Excellent tracking and I love the hyper scroll!! Way to rock out again, Logitech! :-)|PG1031|November 30, 2009
At first I thought this was a pretty good mouse, nice ergonomic shape and I guess the scrolling wheel could be useful at times. But then after a while I realized that this mouse is terrible unresponsive. Many times when I click something, it does not register, and I know that this is not a problem with the batteries. I have tried it out after just putting new ones in. Another problem is it it simply stops registering when to move, which is terrible for games and practically everything else. I have also had a terrible problem with one of the wireless headsets, but that is for another time.|Connor|November 15, 2009
I have had 2 MX620's since my first was replaced by Logitech due to the left button starting to work erratically and registering double clicks after about a year. Now it has probably been another year and the second one is starting to have the same problem. Logitech stood by their product the first time and we'll see what happens this time. It's hard to think of a $50+ mouse being disposable, but so far my Duracells have outlasted the second mouse.When it works it is awesome. The hyperscrolling is so addictive I had to get a Logitech nano for my laptop just for hyperscrolling. Everyone who tries out my nano loves it. The weighting on the 620 is about perfect and the size is also great for my rather long fingers. The click switch between hyper and regular scrolling on the Nanos is a little more user friendly than the switch on the bottom of the MX620. The precision of the laser is great and the range of the 2.4GHz receiver is more than probably anyone would need. I didn't realize I still had my first MX620 turned on and its receiver plugged in when I got the second one and my daughter was messing me up moving the mouse from the next room. (Yes, you can hook up two mice at once for specialty applications).Overall I'd still recommend the MX620 and have quite a few times.|cjtop|October 22, 2009
i have been using this mouse for two years now. I love the scroll wheel and how smooth it glides across the mouse pad, this has been my best mouse ever. BUY IT!!|Pat|September 23, 2009
Probobly more mouse than I needed but was 50% off. I am still playing with the settings, good software with it. Have to set most scroll settings all the way down (I'm not a gamer)Over all, I was going to get the $25 low end laser, but for $5 more, this is 4 times the mouse.Definatly a quality mouse, good feel and logically placed buttons.Knocked 1 star off for use and overall. It dioes require a lot of tweaking.|Kev-Osh-WI|September 5, 2009
It's almost frustrating how close this mouse is to being perfect. At first I was a little weary of the "hyper-fast scroll wheel", but it only took a few days to grown on me so much so that I don't think I'll ever be able to go back. It's also nice to be able to switch between this scrolling and the regular click wheel design.Now for the ugly part: This mouse's signal cuts out. When it does it won't register most mouse clicks and it will seem like your sensitivity is turned way down. This typically only lasts for about 20 seconds and will occur anywhere between zero and five times a day.It's really ashame the mouse cuts out the way it does. Ergonomically it fits perfectly in my slightly large hand and all of its features are designed to be easy to reach but never in the way so that you will accidentally select them.Despite the signal issue, I recommend this mouse. It can be frustrating and discouraging when it happens, but for every second it doesn't happen you'll be in love with this mouse.|Robert|August 12, 2009
The scroll wheel is a huge pain to click with. It is very stiff and make it annoying to open up tabs in Firefox. The shape is great and the features are nice, although it ought to have the scroll ratchet/free switch on the top, not the bottom. The scroll wheel is bad enough that I wouldn't recommend this mouse.|sophos|July 14, 2009
I decided it's time for a new mouse after I inadvertently executed a stock market trade the other day by double-clicking instead of single-clicking. I've always been partial to msft mice, which is a paradox since I've used exclusively Linux for the last 12-13 years but hey -- you gotta give it to msft -- they make decent hardware, unlike some of their operating systems.On with the review:1. Ergonomics -- great! I have a smallish hand and this mouse fits my palm perfectly. This is not to say that it will not fit larger hands,2. Performance: haven't had any problems with erratic cursor movement, lags, or any other problems so far. It works like it should.2. Hyper-wheel (or whatever the marketing term is): great, BUT wheel has a tendency to spin on its own, due to imperfections in manufacturing. No big deal, since it can be disabled.3. Features: too many of them: what's this "search" button for? Overkill, but at least it doesn't get in the way. Same for back/forward buttons (I tend to use keyboard shortcuts).4. Weight: feels balanced in one's hand.5. Manufacturing: looks good.6. Range: this thing works 15 meters (50ft) away from my computer, with the receiver in the back USB of my PC!!!! I am amazed.As with most things in life, you get what you pay for, and in my book 60 USD nowadays is a rather large sum for a mouse. However, I was able to get this mouse on some liquidation sale today for $20 USD, which offsets the price factor.My opinion is that the things one makes constant daily contact with, such as a keyboard, mouse, etc.should be right and no expense should be spared in acquiring the best one can afford.To recap: a mouse with a MSRP of 60 USD which you will use for thousands miles of scrolling, and millions of clicks, guaranteed by the manufacturer for 5 years? Mine, mine, mine! Hopefully no more misplaced hits of the "mine" button.Click away.|Pietro|April 18, 2009
