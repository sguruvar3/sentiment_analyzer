iv had this mouse since 2008 and its awesome except mine was in blue and i like it better, very comfortable good long cord and extremely easy setup and just a really good durable mouse|Georgi74|August 6, 2010
After trying a few wireless mice I went back to a wired mouse. See I have a Mac Mini and Apple has decided that the Magic mouse is truly magic. In fact its the most uncomfortable mouse I have ever tried. So I found this LX3 and what a solid mouse for such a little price. Yes, people with big hands may prefer a little wider mouse. But it plugs in to my Mini and just works! No software, no batteries and no Bluetooth connections that fail!|Johnnythegeek|May 9, 2010
I've had this mouse for a few years now, thats right YEARS. It used to be that i'd go thru them in months, but this thing is too darn reliable. It's like it's become my right hand. It's sensitive and goes where I want it to everytime, it feels great on the hand and it's durable. This mouse continues to work thru more beatings than other mice have. The only bad thing I have to say about this is that the feet have worn off. I guess that happens after a few years. Great product.|W1ldf1re|February 28, 2010
Poor tracking on OS-X 10.4.11. This is a real deal breaker as I do graphics and need that high precision tracking.The body is too skinny so I get hand cramps from using the mouse.All in all a pretty much failed effort.|cooksey|February 1, 2010
So this is one thing that you hate to spend money on. However this was a great purchase. This is well worth the money however it isn't that much! It was a little quick and fast at first but perfect to my touch after I set the mouse speed! I absolutely love it. I do online classes so I spend alot of time on the computer so this was very great! Great Great purchase if your looking!|dmsherer|January 16, 2010
I have this mouse at home and work and it's always worked great. I've never had any issues, and it feels good in my hand. It seems to have a lot of precision, and it moves smooth on my desk.|Michael S|September 28, 2009
We bought 2 of these for our office. Price was attractive, features were interesting, USB connectivity was nice. BUT......both of these units perform very poorly. Have tried them both on 4 different PC's, all running Windows XP Pro. The left button does nothing about 2/3 of the time. Pointer precision was was too sensitive even with "enhance pointer precision" turned off. Even a tiny movement of the mouse caused it to be erratic and jumpy. These are definitely NOT worth the money.|Dave R.|August 26, 2009
I have been using Logitech mouses for years. This mouse was recently purchased to replace a Dell factory mouse (also a Logitech). It fits well in my hand, is easy to use and needed no configuration. It tracks smoothly across the desktop and works with both the Linux PC and the Linux Mac without fail. I recommend this mouse to anyone who wants a stylish mouse that actually works well. This mouse also appears to be easily repaired, so if it breaks and you are technically inclined a quick call to any electronics parts vendor and a few minutes with the soldering iron and you are back to mousing away!|Dan2600|July 20, 2009
This mouse has excellent performance except in one respect: my hand cramped after extended use because its profile is too slim for me to comfortably grasp. It was enough of a problem that I sent off for a replacement the first day.|Imar|July 6, 2009
I was looking for a 2 button and found this. It's good ergonomically and in functionality. Needed to unclick "enhance pointer precision" in XP to get it stable. Other than that, it's a good one.|rjake|June 19, 2009
After my old corded optical mouse took a digger (400dpi), I tried many other mice at the box stores. I found this one to be best for my medium sized hands, and at the right price without a bunch of buttons on it (1000dpi). All I have to say - is that it's a-okay in my book, and for gaming - it's great also.|LNS-Front242|June 19, 2009
I am a brand-loyal Logitech fan when it comes to mice. In fact I won't buy any other brand. That said, this was the worst mouse I have ever used in my life. I am not sure if the mouse simply didn't agree with my system (as I didn't have the opportunity to try it on other systems), but the cursor was incredibly imprecise. Instead of moving a pixel, any slight movement would cause the cursor to lurch several pixels. Simply holding the mouse and moving it slightly would cause the cursor to jerk around nervously on the screen. This might have been okay for internet browsing, but it was horrible for any other tasks like gaming or Photoshop. I've since replaced this mouse with the MX 518 and could not be happier. Sorry Logitech, but this mouse, however fairly it was priced simply was not for me.|Matt T.|May 21, 2009
I was actually a little skeptical when i first looked at this mouse, but I mainly bought it because of the simple elegant (and small) design - it's slim and fits my hand better than the huge, wide bulky mice (that seem like they were designed for men) and my fingers can touch the buttons much easier. The response time is absolutely amazing! It's better than a lot of the mice i've seen that are supposedly made for gaming or anything else, and the price is right too. I recommend this if you're looking for something that isn't bulky and you want smooth, quick response that doesn't have as many buttons as a keyboard. (not all of us want a keyboard replacement in a mouse - hint to the developers)|GirlGamer|April 5, 2009
I haven't had any problems with clicking on these mice. They're comfortable, light, and not overly feature laden. A nice simple mouse that works well. I own three of these; I just like them a lot.|Gary|March 3, 2009
I bought this mouse for its slender shape and great design. After opening it up, I immediately enjoyed the mouse except for the middle click. I guess the way I naturally hold my hand tends toward a tilt click rather than a straight depression, although I have no problems with this on mice with wider middle buttons, including Logitech's own MX series. I eventually got used to this, however, and I hardly ever have that problem now. I guess I trained my hand subconsciously.-1 ease of use star for that.But now it's been just over a month and the left click response is sporadic. If I press on it VERY hard, then it is what you would expect from a normal mouse, but if you press down normally, you'll hear the click, yet 60% of the time either nothing will happen or it will double click. Even worse, if you are holding down the left button and try to grab and drag something or highlight a portion of text, if you aren't pressing down hard the entire time, it may act as if you've removed your finger entirely and then randomly register a click again. It can be pretty infuriating.-1 star for ease of use-4 stars for qualityI must say that that the right click is unaffected by this syndrome. I've tried the mouse on two different computers, and I have tried using it both with and without the Logitech software. I've read similar reviews here, on Newegg, and Amazon now so I don't think this is an isolated incident. I will now have to get a new mouse, because this inconsistent quality renders the mouse worthless and is a huge drain on my productivity. I shouldn't have to think about my mouse and jam my finger down each time.-4 stars for overall ratingFind another mouse. For the price of two of these I could have gotten something much better. Even a $5 generic mouse would be more useful than this.|soydeedo|February 18, 2009
At home I play a lot of games that require fast left clicks--my old logitech that came with my Dell worked much easier.I do like the scroll button much better when searching the InternetI think this would be good for my office where the ergonomics is more important than the clicking motion, but for home I think I'm going to go back to the old style mouse which was less expensive and better ease of use.|Miclt|February 8, 2009
Great mouse but left click barely works now and not as good as old mouse that lasted 5 years (wow!)... had to buy me a new mouse (mx400) hopefully lasts longer... A little disappointed with the LX3 but the mx400 is like 7$ more and should last longer than my LX3 did (not really broken but now I have to press hard on the left click button and well its pointless cause sometimes it wont even register a click).|RogueSniper|February 3, 2009
I have a new PC with Windows Vista and this mouse works great with it. I don't know that it has "Enhanced my Vista experience," but as a mouse, it's great!|dookie|January 25, 2009
I use this mouse on all of my computers: two Macs and one PC running Vista. It is a great, solid, mouse.|Van|January 7, 2009
