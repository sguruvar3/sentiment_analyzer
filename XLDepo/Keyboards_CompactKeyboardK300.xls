Te keyboard feels great, is comfortable to type on, and has excellent keystrokes. However, be careful what you look into on the internet, as the pictures of this keyboard with a bright, pretty glow are misleading. The only things that are backlit are the row of icons over the "F" keys. The rest of that orange you're seeing between the keys? A plastic sheet. I was getting this keyboard because I wanted the orange to go along with my PC theme; IO have orange case lighting. It's still a great keyboard, but when the primary feature you buy it for turns out to be not what you expected, it tends to leave a bad taste in your mouth. I intend to keep it, certainly, and will continue to buy Logitech products. I'll just make sure I do a lot more research next time.|Rahl|September 18, 2010
Just bought it... It's most comfortable keyboard I've ever used :) Laptop style FN keys etc are great. Thanks Logitech|Off|February 2, 2010
I use Design CAD, the commands are all over the place on the keyboard and I use two Logitech trackballs on either side of the keyboard. Some commands are easier with right hand on the keyboard, left on the trackball, especially if the command requires use of the number pad.The size of this keyboard allows me to keep everything on the keyboard tray without having to worry bout the trackballs falling off the tray. It also allows the keyboard tray to close without having to remove the second mouse.Even with my long fingers, It is quicker to use a more compact keyboard and pure joy not having to reach to use the number pad.Only suggestion: illuminate the whole keypad for my weak and aging eyes.Thanks Logitech|JTH|January 29, 2010
I was disappointed that this keyboard was not truly illuminated. The "bright idea" icon on the product page suggests that they letters on the keys light up, but this is not the case. The keyboard tray is merely back-lit which perhaps makes it look cool, but does not assist the eyes in discerning the keys.|Jenn|November 30, 2009
I totally disagree with the other review here. The keyboard is not compact in the sense that it has no keypad, but it's smaller then my previous keyboards. Right now I'm using it and the G110. The K300 is super quite which I prefer and does everything a keyboard should do. It's keys are laptop style and you do have to use the FN key for certain functions, ie., mute, volume, etc.I give it an A if I had to grade it. Well that's my 2 cents.|superg|November 17, 2009
Compact keyboards are a very good idea for reducing the shoulder and neck stress induced from reaching for the mouse across the behemoth keyboards that vendors seem to want to foist upon us. Unfortunately, at 17.5" this is barely any smaller than the other giant keyboards sold. The non-standard key layout will likely appeal to laptop users but not to "normal" keyboard users. There is an extra Function key between the ALT and CTL keys. This is NOT a backlit keyboard. Only the multimedia controls are illuminated.I would very much like to see Logitech make a true quality compact keyboard. Nearly all the compact keyboards currently on the market are based on cheap junky laptop keyboards. Please make a keyboard that is UNDER 15". Lose the keypad. Keep full size keys and spacing, as much as possible. Keep the F keys. The multimedia can go or stay. The necks and shoulders of thousands of computers users are crying out for relief. Small is beautiful!|RealDeal|July 30, 2009
