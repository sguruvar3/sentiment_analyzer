Like other colleagues I hoped that this Mouse will improve the excellent work done with the MX Revolution. Sadly not the case.Not only eliminated the excellent system of the wheel but also worsened the overall design making it bigger and less ergonomic. For users (like me) who have used the MX Revolution this is a catastrophe.The MX Revolution made me leave the Mice (and Keyboards) from Microsoft that I had used for a long time. With this new model I expected improvements over what was already almost perfect, unfortunately the improvements vanish in the failures.I hope you rectify and reinvent a new generation of Mice that combines improvements such: The "Darkfield", the location of the button to switch between windows and the small "Unifying" receiver of the Perfomance model, with the battery life, ergonomics and original system of rolling of the Revolution among other good things already mentioned by others.I've been a fan of the brand for the excellent quality and performance offered by its devices, but this delusion has made me look back to other manufacturers.For now, I will return the Performance and stay with the Revolution until something better comes out.|IvN|September 18, 2010
To be brutally honest with you, there really isn't anything about this mouse that I dislike. I happened to get lucky taking a chance with this mouse and it ending up being as multifunctional as it is. As a programming student and working with a friend, doing websites and other computer related tasks for all types of corporations. I find myself making use of most the software adobe has to offer and I have to say I don't think there are many more mice out there capable of helping make things as easy as this mouse does. Being able to use the programable buttons, which couldn't have been placed any more perfectly, to their full potential by using keystroke for the keyboard shortcuts. Really speeds things up by being able to perform a task on the fly without even taking a hand of your mouse. For example just the other day I was in photoshop just finishing something up on a layer then flattened it, saved it, closed it, opened, dreamweaver, copied and pasted some things looked at it in live view and then saved it. All with one hand faster than I could have with two hands. The fact the shape of it makes it so your hand comfortably rests on instead of feeling like your have to grab ahold of it, doesn't even matter. I personally feel that if you spend allot of time working with computers especially if you work with any of adobes software. Then this mouse is worth the buy. I mean it truly was made for photoshop and dreamweaver.|Buttons=Speed=Money|September 9, 2010
compared to the MX Revolution this mouse:has terrible battery life (1 day on a full charge for me)bad build qualitya useless middle button you can't do much withthe scroll wheel is terrible and cheap (clunks around when you move the mouse if its on hyper scroll)good points:you can change the battery without opening up the mouseawesome reciever upgradecan charge while usingtracks on glass (yay)All in all, a huge disappointment to anywho who already has an MX Revolution. I wish I had never replaced my old mouse due to its charging issues and had just lived with it.|mani3|September 1, 2010
This mouse is probably not the best selection for gaming given its weight, however for business and productivity applications, its an awesome mouse. The ability to charge and continue using the mouse is a long needed feature in the wireless mouse world. The darkfield laser really makes it a breeze to use, even in questionable situations/conditions. This mouse is everything i could ask for in a business mouse.Pros: Useable while charging, Good Battery Life, Responsive unit all around.Cons: Weight may cause delayed reflex for video game players.|John B|August 26, 2010
Having got this as a replacement for my non charging mx revolution, I have to say, this mouse is pretty awesome.Pros:Ergonomics. Fits just a tad small in my hand but thats hardly noticeable.Functionality. As I primarily surf the web, the mouse serves its purpose. Nothing spectacular but nothing bad either. Just good. I never needed the extra buttons in the Mx Revo. so this step down wasn't noticable either. +1 to the nifty placement of the app switcher too.Ability to charge while using the mouse, although the cord is just thick enough too be annoying to use but thin enough to use.Hyper Scrolling.Replaceable battery.Small usb Dongle.Darkfield tracking, although i haven't even used yet so this only applies if you have a glass desk or table.Cons:The button switch to go from hyper scrolling to regular scrolling is a big step down from the Mx Revo's automatic switching.The silver sliver of metal makes it look weird. But thats just me.Horizontal scrolling is ficky and takes some fiddling sometimes.I don't know if its just me but its very hard to middle click (click the scroll wheel down.) I did some tests and you HAVE to push at the base ( the portion right above the scroll switcher button) in order to register a click. Although you can hear a click if you press it anywhere, it only registers at the base, at least for mine anyways.Overall very good mouse but not without a few quirks. Mx Revo refugees, beware it may not live up to your expectations. And to Logitech, you should really go back to the automatic scrolling switcher. Or at least have a method, say a button, to switch between the automatic scrolling and manual.Fantastic Mouse! No cramps yet :)|Aboobitybop|August 25, 2010
I've been a long time user of the MX Revolution (it's been well over 4 years since I bought it), and my friend purchased one of these and has been revering it as a fantastic mouse. While it is, some of the things that made the Revolution great have been taken out; a huge turn off for me. The freescrolling now has a button that you have to push to enable (where the middle mouse button used to be), instead of just flicking the scroll wheel fast enough. Also, the new chrome look has made it look...odd, and the way the battery levels are displayed is definitely a huge leap back; it's no longer always lit up, and it's got an indicator next to it. The side buttons along the left rim have also gotten substantially fatter and wider, similar to many other mice, whereas the buttons on the Revolution were very slim, and pointed further out instead of being flat, giving them a nice contrast.While the aesthetic changes like the chrome and the buttons aren't enough to make me avoid purchasing this, the removal of the internal mechanism for the scroll wheel an the battery indicator are (you can argue the battery indicator is an aesthetic change, of course, but to me it seemed more of a feature that they were under the rim and had no "indicator" that's saying "Hey stupid, this is the battery level!").For anyone else that's as ficky as me where these are an issue, you can still purchase the MX Revolution on Amazon new from WorldWide Distributors.For logitech, if any of your employees actually read these reviews, you should seriously consider bringing back the scroll mechanism and the way the battery light displayed, because those features contributed to the "minimalistic" (if you can say that for a mouse with 13 inputs) feel of the Logitech Revolution that made it so stylish and functional. Merge the two mice together; keep the new charger, the more refined lazer, and the smaller receiver, and the neat new thumb button, but bring back the overall design of the Revolution; it'll be the greatest mouse ever.3/5.|BrickInTheHead|August 23, 2010
I'm very satisfied with this mouse and it's the best mouse I ever owned so far. But if I need to mention the things that need improvement in my opinion they are:1. Battery life could be better2. The USB cableIf the battery needs recharging you have to attach the usb cable and I think it's way to thick and inflexible. It's too noticeable when moving the mouse.3. The scroll wheel is a bit unsteady|wesley|August 23, 2010
Pros* It feels good in my hand* The wireless works* Software works* Decent battery life and the recharge via USB feature is nice.Cons*Wheel and tilt are *way* too sensitive, even when turned down in the software. Clicking on a line of text often takes two or three tries to get it right. I have to work so hard to get this thing right that I'm getting some carpal-tunnel-like symptoms.* Had to disable the tilt wheel feature completely.* The third button (wheel) is unusable, so I had to disable that and use one of the thumb buttons as an alternative.* The wheel either became really jittery or stopped working for a few weeks right after I bought it. I think something must have gotten into it. Although it works now.I like Logitech gear, and generally recommend it. The low-end three-button wired logitech wheel mouse performs better overall than this beast, and doesn't exhaust my mouse hand like this one does. As much as I want to love it, it's wearing me out. I'm hunting for a new mouse, and will still consider Logitech in my next purchase. This Performance Mouse MX, unfortunately, is going to end up in a drawer. :-(|MassiveDynamic|August 20, 2010
Because the axis of the tilt wheel does not follow the left/right click buttons, the left side of the scroll wheel is not raised enough. This makes it difficult to scroll to the right using the scroll wheel. Everything else about the mouse is great- the tracking is VERY smooth. My previous mouse was an MX Laser that I used for 2+ years that finally died. That one had a charging dock and I really miss that feature!!!|Mikey|August 17, 2010
Been a fan of Logitec products (but didn't rule out other brands) and was looking for a new keyboard and mouse but looked at seperates as I didn't like the available packages this time. Picked up the iluminated keyboard which I love but wont go into detail as I am reviewing the mouse.I was a little concerned with the reviews and had occasional lag but solved this by removing the reciever from the back of the PC to the front...no more lag ever . If you have a USB on you screen this would be even better. To bad it isn't compatable with my 2.4 wireless card.Other reviews say the little finger isn't supported, would be nice but hasn't caused any discomfort. Miss the recharging/reciever cradle of past but find the cable to be quality and easy given I get 2 - 3 weeks per charge, just be careful plugging it in as it is a rather odd angle on the front of the mouse. Only other thing I have noticed is sometimes a slight rattle from the mouse as I type which may be due to using a pull out instead of ridgid tray.I have always been very satisfied with Logitech products and their support and believe that I have found another winner.|----|August 14, 2010
This mouse is great. The best mouse on the market period! The Programmability, ease of use, quality and ergonomic design make this mouse ten steps above all others. Finally the customer service of Logitech and their product quality guarantee “put the icing on the cake” when it comes to mice, webcams, and keyboards… I will ONLY buy Logitech.|Alex|August 1, 2010
I like that the rechargeable battery can be replaced, I had a MX1000 that I had to toss because the battery wasn't replaceable. I liked the MX1000 cradle charger but toward the end of its life the contacts were not making a reliable connection so the usb plug will probably be better for longevity. I like the ergonomics, features and it is the best replacement for the MX1000 I could find. I was hesitant to spend this much for this mouse after reading the negative online reviews about the current quality of Logitech mice but other than the price and the micro-usb plug ( it goes in at an odd angle and would be easier if it were regular size) I have no complaints. I'm not really sure why they included a carrying bag for the cables of a desktop mouse but I'm sure I'll find some use for it.|bwb|July 29, 2010
Remarkably, I didn't expect this mouse to be very good.I purchased this mouse as an experiment to see if it could possibly be the best mouse for me and to my surprise, it turned out to be true.My previous mouse: Apple Magic MouseProblems with the Magic Mouse:1. Surface too sensitive, causing serious problems when editing videos.2. Looses connection frequently.3. Unable to rest hand on the mouse -- too low -- and -- the multi-touch surface prohibits resting the hand.4. Battery indicator shows full charge until it is too late. Must replace batteries -- not rechargeable.Solutions with the Logitech Performance Mouse MX:1. Surface very comfortable with rubberized edges. A pleasure to hold.2. Never lost connection since using it. Turn it on, it's instant connection immediately with no waiting.3. The ability to rest my hand on the mouse comfortably is a feature I didn't realize I missed with the other brand.4. The ability to charge this mouse (while using) or directly plugged into an electrical outlet is the perfect solution.The solid feel is very nice, but I find that horizontal scrolling a bit tricky. It works when tweaked from the Logitech Control Center, but it's not as smooth as the Apple Magic Mouse.The numerous programmable buttons are very nice and missed terribly with the Magic Mouse.The scroll wheel is a pleasure to use. Not quite as precise as the Magic Mouse, but very smooth.When comparing all features, the Logitech Performance Mouse MX has the competition beat.It's a bit heavy to use, but overall a much better and more reliable mouse.This mouse is compatible with both the Mac and PC.Recommended: YES|TechTalkGuy|June 22, 2010
This mouse , overall, is a very uncomfortable mouse for me. Unlike the revolution, this mouse has no support for my piny so my ring finger and pinky finger are smushed against any surface I am on. the other features are nice but its not a great mouse unless it feels right in my hand.|Yooner|June 22, 2010
I really like the MX Performance, good feautures and pretty easy to use (although I seem to hit the zoom button a lot while trying to press the back button on the side of the mouse). The darkfield and mini-receiver are great and deliver the goods.Points I am less happy about:- this mouse feels like plastic, much cheaperthan the MX Revolution;- the plug for recharging the mouse feels very vulnerable. I miss my recharge-cradle...|Irukandji|June 20, 2010
My MX revolution broke because a friend at school sat on it. Seeing that this is the natural replacement product, I decided to give it a go. It is nearly identical in size and a slight bit taller. It takes a firm shake to wake it up if you've been away for a while but it is only a moment before it is ready to go again. The wireless receiver is really small and is a great fit.One thing that is really cool is that the Li-Ion battery is really a rechargeable AA battery. This will be convenient later when the battery is older and cant hold a charge or if I want to be able to have a fully charged mouse and I don't want to spend the time to recharge it.$100 is a lot for a mouse but it is a mouse that will last for several years. So far, Logitech has provided me with quality products for several years.|Cjymiller|June 18, 2010
I have used many Logitech mouses previously, and this mouse meets my expectation same as my other previous Logitech products. However, personally, I don't like the location of the "back" and "forward" buttons of this Performance MX mouse because thumb is used too much whereas index finger is used too less (only used to click "left" button). So, in my opinion, its "Back" and "Forward" button should be relocated in a way to be clicked with "index" finger rather than "thumb". Other than this problem, this mouse is great. I definitely recommend this mouse if you consider to buy a new wireless mouse.|Love_Logitech|June 18, 2010
First off, the molded shape has reduced my carpel tunnel problems.So upon opening this product i've been on a quest to find what it does and doesnt work on.Glass: Works ok, slower then normalSmooth Fabric: works great, tends to pull the fabric a bit as you slide itmicrofiber/other woven materials: does not work well, very slow speeds, and the tracking can jump around as you pass over different woven strandsBooks: works great, significantly different texture or color can change how the tracking worksCardboard: works well, so long as its a flat surface (like a box) and one color, different colors will change how fast the tracking is as you pass over them (going from red to blue)carpet: does not work, to many surfacesTile/laminate/lenoleum: works great, same issue with texture and color as mentioned above.Wood: works good, same texture/color issuescement: works, but very slow. May be because all the cement i can find is on the road and is a very rough texture.walls: works great, texture issue applies, color not so much (i dont have huge color changes in my walls, they are all white)Battery Life is about 19-20 hours of constant use. Can be charged and used at the same time (WONDERFUL features!)even after all the testing i have done the foot pads on my mouse are looking great, no bent ends, doesnt grab anything.With software installed you can change the scroll wheel to scroll from 1+ lines (i havent tested the upper limit, currently set to 3, the default), on the free motion selection, i have been able to get to over the 70,000th cell down in excel 2007 on a single spin (crazy to watch)With the software installed you can change what the buttons do (very interesting to swap the right and left buttons, then let someone else use the computer....very funny!)You get a pleather case with this mouse, it contains the charging cord, a usb extender (that looks really funny) and a few other things. All cables have velcro strips to keep them tidy inside the case. Case is great to carry around, makes it very easy to find the right cord in the laptop bag (or for me, my school bag)Price was fairly high, but I'm a strong believer in "You get what you pay for" you can also find it on sale at different times of the year at consumer stores (Bestbuy, Frys, Target) and online (Newegg.com, tigerdirect.com, amazon.com)Deffinately worth the purchase. BTW: i have tested it on water, it will track on a smooth surfaced water (but quickly deteriorates because, well your touching the water with the mouse)|Jalharad|June 18, 2010
Just bought one...had 2 MediaPlay before (these 2 in my opinion..best mouses in the world..u can use it 10h and still have no problems with ur hand) and I can say MX almoust fills the gap...but...the problem is the lack of special volume and forwrd/back buttons like the MediaPlay has...and it would require a lower profile at the back (my hand stays too high). Also the price is high..BUT!..u have the special black light..and it works perfect on glass :D wich is SUPERB!!! (i needed that in my kitchen where I have a glass table)...Now I've set the volume control on the side moves of the wheel, but it's anoying sometimes (moust anoying is the left-side movement of the wheel because of the mouse shape).Final words: GREAT mouse (for gamers too), very easy to use...and PLEASE..RECREATE THE MEDIAPLAY MOUSE! (btw...MP mouse cost me max 35eu instead of 80 for the MX) :) (pardon my english!) :D|GTSKA|June 18, 2010
Not all the keys are programmable. It rattles and is very noisy. The quality feels very cheap for a mouse this expensive. Keep in mind that if you are interested in using 2 unifying devices with 2 computers that Logitach doesn't support this. It's one usb dongle at a time.|Supercoder|June 17, 2010
