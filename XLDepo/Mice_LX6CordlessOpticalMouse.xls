The build quality or this mouse is rock solid, it feels robust and sturdy and the accompanying design is awesome. Pointer accuracy is flawless and there is no skipping or jumping of any kind. The left-right tilting scroll wheel is very useful and can be programmable to do whatever you like... but only if you install the downloadable software from logitech.com, which gets me thinking - why hasn't all the necessary software already been included with the mouse itself? Sure, I can download the necessary drivers in a snap, but not everybody is as computer savvy.The only thing that gets on my nerves about this mouse is the middle button... it's ROCK HARD! I have to bend my finger just to click it and occasionally I move it to the left and invoke a keystroke that plays the previous song in my music playlist. I can only hope that it softens up after a few weeks of use...The wireless connection between the mouse and my PC seems to be stable, haven't noticed any interference or connection issues. Oh, and speaking of which, the wireless receiver is HUGE! It's as large as the mouse itself! Therefore, mobile users - stay away, this is a desktop only mouse.|Nenad|July 1, 2010
To those who are complaining about the corded receiver, I guess I have the older version where the cord was optional to extend the range of the receiver. Well, my receiver enclosure broke off after a year or so. Since I use it for my laptop I find I have to squeeze the butt of the receiver to pull it out of the USB slot. After a few months of doing that, the mouse started doing weird things -- jumps around randomly and less responsive. I'm here hoping to find a replacement receiver but I guess they aren't universal. I wouldn't buy anything that has a large receiver anymore, those smaller ones that barely stick out seem to last longer.|Flint|June 14, 2010
This is my first cordless mouse and it is so much more than I ever expected. I had only wanted to stop fighting the cord all of the time, and now, not ony am I no longer fighting a cord, I received so much more.Pluses: No ball, multiple choices for left/right click buttons an their functios, multiple choices for scroll mouse function (I use the magnifying function), can set different functional use for when gaming, tells you your battery status, can tilt the scroll, push it down, or just scroll and select from many function for them to perform and still maintain scrolling, smoking software updates online, etc..I have never been in a state of biss over a computer product, but this mouse has made my life that much better that I am their now. I have "Cordless Mouse Bliss."|krissylynnuy|April 7, 2010
I had the LX7 and LOVED it. It was wireless and had a USB thumb drive receiver that was PERFECT for use with a laptop. Low profile, did not get in the way, did not take up valuable desk space. I lost it when a pipe burst in my attic flooding my living room and ruining my laptop and mouse. So when I went to replace the mouse, I was disappointed that the store did not have the LX7, but it had the LX6 which looked very much like the LX7. I read the information on the box and it never mentioned that the reciever was on a 3' cord. When I opened the box I was really disappointed. And now I am mad because in looking at the LX6 on Logitech's website it does not disclose the corded receiver, I say foul!!! Even if I was buying the mouse for a desktop I would still want the USB thumb drive receiver. Otherwise the LX6 works great, but I am going to try to sell it to buy the LX7 or any other mouse with a USB wireless thumb drive receiver. The cord is very annoying and life is too complicated to be dragging around yet another piece of electronic eqipment. Thumb drives rule!!!!!|Auntie MB|March 28, 2010
Works fine, does not neet to be real close to reciever, but the reciever needs to be insulated or separated from the computer box. We set it on a piece of styrofoam and it works wonderfully.|accurate|March 25, 2010
Yes the mouse is wireless, but they failed to mention that there is a CORDED receiver that has to be very close to the mouse for it to work. Not impressed with the lack of information on how this mouse really works. Bought it out of a catalog and everything sounded great for the money. I guess you get what you pay for. If you are looking for a wireless mouse, look for something else, not this one!|Greg|March 1, 2010
Very nice mouse, no problems at all! Works great with Windows 7. Could maybe have a back and forward button on it, but overall, works great!|Alex|February 28, 2010
I bought it last February. It worked great for a year and it just died for no reason. I am disappointed. In my option Legitech is a great brand for the price and quality. We have 2 other Logitech mice in our home, just different styles. I would highly recomend this brand. I am going to get a new on asap. Hope this info helps.|navy05hondaccord|February 5, 2010
I don't see how this has such a low over-all rating. I bought this at a Best Buy along with the highly useful and still in amazing condition logitech wave wireless. Both have never let me down. They don't need battery replacement in ages, and also the invisible optical laser is great to have. It is just sensitive enough. The unifier work fine too btw! Also they are dead on with the batery life. You'll replace it almost every 8 months. I replace mine maybe a least once or so a year...I've owned both the logitech wave and this particular mouse for around 4 years, and won't need to upgrade for awhile still... You can trust this review ;).|HardKohrJD|January 2, 2010
Excellent. No problems, had for about a week in a half. I recommend this! Compatible with Windows 7 too, what I'm using. Also has good grip, someone with a big hand I guess.|Alex from NY|December 8, 2009
I think it is ok for the desktop, wireless adapter is very big, it conflict with my wireless keyboard driver a little bit. After I was able to fix it, it is very nice one. I like to press wheel mouse to left or right. The best part, it can handle with all surface.|Tony|November 28, 2009
Logitech failed to mention that the cordless mouse has a 3 ft long cord attatched to the receiver. This mouse is not a good choice for you if you are using a laptop.|henof4chicks|November 19, 2009
i love it for everything i have had it two years no issues then i started gaming and then my hand started to hurt it needs too have a better feel to it|Garrett|October 24, 2009
This mouse is actually pretty good for an everyday user. I have this on my desktop and it's great for normal usage, though I would STRONGLY recommend against gaming with this mouse. It does have a little lag from time to time, but for the most part is not too bad. I have had MUCH better luck with this than I have with the LX5 as far as connection. I use the LX5 at work, and if I am further than 10 inches away from the receiver, it cuts in and out REALLY badly. Also, and I know this is going to be with most wireless devices, if I get a call or txt on my cell, I may as well not even try to use either the LX5 or the LX6. Sad because I love the mouse, but I never seemed to have a problem with my cheap Microsoft wireless set. Hmm... Good for the money, though!|Bielzebub|September 28, 2009
I was more than happy for this product when I got it. Unfortunately after 6 months of usage it doesn't work correctly anymore. The pointer moves perfectly smoothly but the left mouse button is unresponsive. Sometimes the mouse button gets released even though I'm still pressing it - I love it when it happens while I'm drag&dropping and the file drops to a wrong place. Playing FPS games is impossible - sometimes it shoots and sometimes it doesn't.|Ruuttu|August 12, 2009
It was great for 5 months then it stopped scrolling. No matter how many times you would move the roller.|kkj|August 6, 2009
I bought this LX6 when I decided to set up a "docking station" for my MacBook. Not wanting to spend too much money on a mouse, I thought "that looks just like the mouse I already have..."I had a LX7 that came with a keyboard and mouse combo that I had used on my PC. I was repuposing this combo for a server machine, and had bought an Apple USB Keyboard for the MacBook. (Apple makes wonderful keyboards and horrible mice - go figure.)Anyway, it wasn't until I got it home that I noticed that the LX6 does not have the forward and back buttons I used so much on the LX7. Add that to the fact that the LX7 that was made specifically for the combo wouldn't work separately on the LX6 receiver (so I couldn't just put the LX6 on the server), and I was stuck with the inferior mouse for my main setup.That being said, the mouse tracks well, feels great in the hands, and has very good battery life. I've never had a problem with it. I just wish more retailers carried the LX7. If this one ever dies, I'm ordering a LX7 to replace it. Now, if they only made it in Bluetooth!!|Colorado MJ|July 17, 2009
I bought this mouse for a new desk top computerand it is great. If you want a wireless mouse that does not need its usb receiver to be plugged in and than removed everytime you use it.....this is the mouse!With its on and off power switch on the mouse.....I am sure it can get long term use out of its battery....it even has an indicator that shows battery status.A wireless mouse for general everyday use......this is the mouse, I looked at more expensive and cheaper ones before deciding on this one.|Desperado|July 14, 2009
In less than a year I went through 6 sets of batteries. Then the cursor started darting around in the opposite direction of my movement. None of the recommended trouble shooting was effective. Finally it just died.|Royal Wulff|June 2, 2009
Logitech.com says that the LX6 has a wireless receiver. The receiver is not wireless.|Fred|May 19, 2009
