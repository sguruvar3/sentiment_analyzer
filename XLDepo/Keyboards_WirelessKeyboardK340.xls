I bought this to use as an HTPC keyboard. It meets all my needs; light weight, stylish, wireless unifying receiver, easy to store away, 20'-30' reach. I'm not fond of the keys. Typing is not quiet nor are the keys as easy to type on as many other keyboards. Chicklet keys would be nice and maybe a beveled look instead of the rounded edges. The color and size are exactly what I wanted. Again, it meets my needs but I don't feel it deserves a 5 star rating.|Cor|September 17, 2010
I've only had this keyboard for a few months and the labels wear off the keys. Multimedia keys all require FN key to access, but that's only on the right side. So if you're right handed, they're very awkward to use.Good things: feel of keys and small size. Also the wireless link works flawlessly.However, the key labels wearing off leaves it looking pretty bad. Not recommended.|Bob|May 11, 2010
Overall, this keyboard is fine. A couple of niggles I have are the lack of backlighting on the keys (to conserve battery life no doubt) and no option to recharge the keyboard like the Performance MX wireless mouse.One problem I have noticed while gaming is that the keys do not always work correctly. For example, while running forward and strafing right, I cannot jump (spacebar input is not recognised). If I run forward and strafe left, I can still jump. I imagine there are other key combinations that cause input not to be recognised, but after literally one minute of gameplay I find I will not be using this keyboard to game on at all. Other than that (and the two niggles I mentioned earlier), it is a fairly decent purchase.|R J Gaffney|April 6, 2010
I just have to say, this is one of the greatest products Logitech has came out with. This keyboard is amazing! Light weight, wireless, on/off switch to save battery life, slick black, and most important its unifying. I love it and top it all off, i also bought a M505 mouse with the order. I'm a huge Logitech fan and been buying there products for years. They never seem to disappoint, and I recommend everybody to strongly consider purchasing this product. You won't regret it.|Tech Guy|February 2, 2010
I like this keyboard a lot, and it works really well. Even though it does have nice keys, the ergonomics are not that great. This can be easily solved with a wrist rest. I also think that the range seems a little crumby. But i don't think that my vote should really count though, because i have a solid maple desk, which probably shortens the range considerably. The unifying receiver is great otherwise. It works great with my Anywhere Mouse MX. All in all this is good keyboard that looks cool, and I know that i will get good use out of it.|Mouse|January 20, 2010

Purchase this keyboard for portability and it serves the purpose well. The keypads are soft and easy to type on. Furthermore, it's lightweight and the quality of plastics used is durable. I'm able to type across the living room. Only complaint is that the battery cover is a bit flimsy.|Kenji458|November 28, 2009
