Originally, I bought the Anywhere MX, which I still think is outstanding. So, for the office, I bought the M500, which has many of the same features in a corded interface. Still love the free-wheeling scroll wheel, but, after a few months, the mouse sensitivity has seriously declined. Now, if I don't have it on a specific mouse pad, it doesn't track. Maybe I just website challenged, but I have yet to find the place on the Logitech website where I can get warranty assistance.|ljerryd|August 27, 2010
I bought this mouse in a pinch to replace a G5 with a loose wire, not really understanding the "Fast Scroll" advertised on the box, but liking Logitech and the price.I am very impressed with the fast scroll feature. At first I thought it was a gimmick easily replaceable by just turning up the lines scrolled per tick on a regular mouse, but the combination of precision and speed can't be achieved like that. It is essentially a toggle button that changes the wheel from a free-spinning mode (it will spin for at least 10 seconds with a good twirl) to a more conventional gentle lock on each tick. With a little practice you can set it to scrolling at your scanning speed and quickly get to the meat of an article (or find where you left off a forum thread, or many similar instances), and when you really do need a line-by-line scroll you can easily switch back. The physical sensation of flicking the wheel adds something else, making the experience very intuitive and somehow satisfying. The wheel is also the best (much better than the G5 even) I've used: it never accidentally spins when I try to click, or clicks when I try to spin, and is even usable for side scrolling.My only complaint is that during very fast motions the mouse can't keep up and sometimes turns unpredictably or stands still. I can't remember ever experiencing this except when trying to flick quickly around in a video game; for casual desktop use this is my favorite mouse.|apikoros|August 26, 2010
I just upgraded from a much older Logitech mouse which was getting pretty old, and I am VERY happy with this mouse.The grip is extremely comfortable and similar to my old Logitech mouse which makes me really happy.The second this that popped out was how the scroll wheel can be set to spin freely, making long webpages no problem!I just use a mouse at my desk, so having a cord is no problem - it provides better performance than cordless ones, and has no batteries to worry about!The buttons included on the mouse are really useful and I think they're well placed, and the optional software for the mouse makes it super easy to set the buttons to do tons of different things.|matt|August 17, 2010
I use this with my iMac, but have used it with Windows, and it works nicely. I just plugged it in on both my Mac and a PC and it worked fine on both.The two thumb buttons have different default functions on Windows and OS X. On Windows, they're back and forward webpage browsing buttons. On OS X, the "browser-back" button works Expose, and the "browser-forward" button doesn't seem to do anything. I like it fine that way, so I don't feel the need to mess with the settings.I have pretty large hands for a girl (8 inches from palm to middle finger), but I found that a lot of mice I tried out at the store were still too big for my hand to fit comfortably over them. This Logitech was the only one that seemed to be made for a hand my size.I mainly use my mouse for internet use, World of Warcraft and Photoshop, and it's worked fine for all those things.The scroll-wheel is able to scroll horizontally, which was a selling point for me after I got spoiled by Apple's scroll-ball. It seems to work a little weird in at least one program - if you try to lower/raise the volume in iTunes, the volume bar seems to go "backwards" from the way you click the horizontal scroll-wheel. Other than that, it works fine, and that's Apple's problem, NOT Logitech's.Someone else on this site expressed confusion over the button under the scroll-wheel. I figured it out! The button toggles smooth scrolling and "clicky" scrolling. If it's smooth, you can scroll once quickly and the page will keep scrolling. If it's "clicky," it'll only go a little way and you'll have to scroll again. I prefer the "clicky" scroll-wheel, but you that's just my preference.All in all, a great mouse. It even works on frosted glass! I was really surprised. I've included a picture of the mouse on the frosted glass of my desk, and my hand on the mouse so you can see the proportional size.|raygungirl|August 16, 2010
I have to say that I really liked this mouse until one of the glide pads caught on the edge of my mouse pad and just folded in half. Is this a weak spot in the design? YES!|Retoocs|May 18, 2010
I haven't had this mouse for very long, but I had the version before it. This mouse is fantastic for internet browsing, I love the hyper-fast scrolling. I personally use this mouse for gaming, I know its not what it is intended to do, but I'm too cheap to spend over $100 on a gaming mouse. I'd definitely recommend this mouse to cheap gamers, and people that just want to browse the net. This mouse is extremely comfortable, and I would definitely recommend it.|Nat|May 11, 2010
An agreeable mouse with style and an above-average feature set. Recommended.I started out looking for more design quality and hand-to-mouse comfort than was offered by the stock equipment in my desktop PC package. I also wanted a product that I hoped would stand up better under light use than did the Microsoft Optical mouse I had been using.After looking at Microsoft, Logitech, and a few other brands, I selected the Logitech M500 because of its interesting design, shape, and style accents, and its comfortable fit. (For me, the fit was better than that of the also attractive Logitech LX3, which appears to be slightly shorter in overall length.) The price was right, too, because cheaper products had left me unimpressed.I soon came to appreciate the additional features of the M500 along with its style: the built-in backward/forward buttons are useful for Web browsing and for navigating the Windows Explorer address bar. (Though these buttons can easily be activated when you don't intend to.) I didn't expect to have much use for hyper-fast scrolling but found that it also comes in handy: when a page or document gets long, why not hyper-scroll?Left and right scroll with the optional Logitech SetPoint software can also be useful, but I haven't used it often. SetPoint offers a number of other customization options, but for now the basics are fine. The "help" descriptions in SetPoint do an above-average job of explaining the options and what the settings can actually do. I was, however, unable to get SetPoint to re-program the backward/forward buttons to operate the previous/next buttons in Microsoft Live Mail.A couple of other points: the M500's laser tracking seems very "smooth" and exact. I notice when I use the scroll wheel to click on a web link, it requires solid pressure at just the right spot on the wheel, otherwise the wheel tends to roll forward and move the pointer off the link before activating it.I was pleasantly surprised to learn that Logitech still cares about mice!|Nestor|May 4, 2010
I dont see why people complain about it as much. Its great smooth mouse. Not sure what the button udner scrolling wheel is but thats okay. Scrolling wheel is amazing and great feeling. The mouse fits very nice in your hand and has great back and foward buttons on the side which are very handy once you get use to them being there.I would reccomend for anyone that is doing normal computer things. Maybe not for gaming but a great mouse.|Cody|April 3, 2010
It feels great on your hand, all the buttons in the right places and that hyper scroll saves a lot of scrolling. The clicking could be a bit more quiet though. For the price, it's worth it.|JC|April 2, 2010
Well first the pros:-its nice right handed mouse,-feet quite nice in the hand,-have nice light scroll,and now the const:- very bad for the gamers! has very low polling rate THAT CANT BE CHANGED!!!! its like mouse for 5$ are better than this one :/- loud clicks- drivers aren't supplied with the mouse|Jack|March 19, 2010
The mouse first of all is not a bad mouse. Sensitivity is ok, the boutons are well working on Window 7 as it should. It is true that we need to download the Setpoint software to customise the buttons. And what is bad about it, it is that it did NOT came with the mouse. So people who are buying it are expected to download the software from the Logitech official website.However, the problem is that some buttons do not respond well in games. I tried to make shorcuts to keys using the mouse and it did not respond to well. I am not sure whether it is only me. But I currently have the problem to press several time on that buttont to perform the action I need in game.In anyhow, this is not a bad mouse to use in office. The scroll system is well integrated (although we have to click the button in the middle to swap mode). It is also a shame that it does not have DPI switcher.|Xeno|February 23, 2010
Don't buy this if you need a PS/2 connector or use a switchbox for multiple computers. This mouse only works when you plug it directly into the USB of your computer. Wish they had put that more specifically in the Specifications. Now I have to return it. Can't say much for the performance itself because I only got it to work on my laptop and don't need a corded mouse there.|Barbs|February 15, 2010
Very solid mouse for your money! It does almost every thing you need it to. The hyperfast scroll is awesome but can turn it off with the press of a button of needed. The software controles for osx are handy but they should really add more controls to scroll through web pages and tabs.|lonewolf|January 31, 2010
The clicking is very hard. My right finger starts to hurt after about an hour. I'm going to return it to best buy. Pointer seems to overrun target. Hard to drag across surface.Poor click and too loud.|Lance|January 5, 2010
I usually don't read site reviews in the company of the product. but I have to recommend this mouse:it is extremely comfortable, of course that is very personal.the feature that got me was the "hyper scroll" - it is incredible! i'm a student and run over large reports and it makes it very easy.(it only has forward\backward buttons, but i don't need more)the overall quality of construction so far is fine. from history with Logitech they are pretty sturdy.performance wise - it could be a bit more accurate and\or faster.i decided to return to corded mice, so far it feels fine, no worries for butteries.overall - go buy it.(it's price is reasonable compared to other mice)|Dan|December 13, 2009
I got this yesterday, to use both with a desktop and a laptop computer. The USB connectivity takes about 10 seconds the first time to install, and no time for every other connection. So far, this mouse has all the features I wanted, at a low price tag. It is also very comfortable. I love the hyper-wheel! I can go either 1 scroll at a time, or let go fly with a single flick! I'd buy one again in a minute!|Soccerluver13|November 9, 2009
Just bought one to the office and it was totally worth the money. Great ergonomics, but i guess not for smaller hands. Love the little touches they did over the MX620. The wheel is excellent, easy to push, side buttons are just where they are supposed to be the way they are supposed to be. Great mouse.|bart|August 19, 2009
The mouse has a Forward and backwards button on the left-side.It's VERY easy to click on them while surfing and cause your web page to either go to the previous page or forward!It's very annoying.|Looking|July 31, 2009
This mouse was pretty excellent. Very smooth, I love the back and forward buttons and it is extremely comfortable to use.The only issue I have with this mouse is the lifespan. I bought it about a year ago and now the right click button has stopped working accurately. I often have to click it multiple times for it to work.I do a lot of first person gaming with it so maybe the wear and tear on it is starting to show but it seems rather early. Usually my mice die from the bottom pads coming off but these are still going strong.|Matt|June 25, 2009
I got this mouse from my boyfirend as a gift.My fingers are long and hands are huge. The shape of this mouse solves my problem. I love the free wheel and side keys. It is very convenient when I have to read through a long document. The price is fair. I will recommand it to my friends.|Vivida|June 11, 2009
