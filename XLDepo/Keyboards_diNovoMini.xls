Awesome product- Don't have cable or satellite- all Netflix and Win Media Center- This product is awesom- small enough not to be intrusive yet large enough to be functional as a full keyboard. I have had mine for 9 months. Battery lasts about 3 weeks till the next charge.My kids can use it- a 4 year old, and my wife loves it. Range has never been a concern.Driver used to stink when I first purchased it- but updated last month, and drivers are much better.Price is very steep- I show this to faimly and they love the product but because of the price, they will not purchse it.Overall- great.|Richy|September 2, 2010
I have now been using this keyboard for almost two years, I use it on a daily basis to control the computer connected to the TV in the living room where I watch all my movies and TV series.All I can say is that this is the best keyboard ever, fair enough the arrows keys can be a little flimsy sometimes but once you learn how to use them properly it just becomes second nature.I still think this is a little over priced, I managed to get mine for £50 which was very good indeed. I would not use anything else. Also no one believes me when I say that this is my full mouse and keyboard to control the computer, they think its some sort of translator hahaGreat product just needs to work on the arrow keys. If not for that I would have given it 5 stars. Recommended.|LondonDragon|May 18, 2010
Great idea... but the finaly product is garbage. Worked OK for a month, now it has some MAJOR problems... it seems like it doesn't send the (ex. type, click etc) information via bluetooth til i move the mouse then it all happens at once.the mouse portion was never any good, and when you switch it to media mode, the cursor buttons don't work well. it actually shows you in the manual how to press on them due to the design flaw.... HOW CHEEZY.also, the software thought it was something else when i installed it.all in all, awesome idea for a htpc... they just need to work on it.|Mikey|May 16, 2010
Adequate is the word to describe this product, cheaply made, not very ergonomic and VERY overpriced.They could have done better, I'd probably have been better off waiting for the Mini diNovo 2 or the like, when they have ironed out all of the issues plaguing it.All I can say is I am glad I bought it second hand from eBay.|Kalavere|March 16, 2010
I would def recommend this product. I haven't had any troubles with mine so far works great and excellent reception. Some one metioned it doesn't work with vista 64 but that is what i am running and it works just fine. To boot with vista you don't have to install the programs its a plug and play hardwear.|Sky|March 14, 2010
I bought this device in Taiwan Airport - duty free shop, less expensive compare buying in HK. Anyway a good device to control MM works with computer and my LCD TV|Home User|February 17, 2010
Unit resets itself constantly, battery retaining clip flimsy and has broken. Function is good with DVD software but not durable enough to be used as a remote if you drop them as much as we do at our place. Unit has functioned in this manner since day one.|Aunty Social|February 16, 2010
This device looks great and was smaller than expected, but the setpoint software won't work on my Vista 64 Bit system. I've tried reinstalling and following all of the troubleshooting steps related to this issue, but the mouse and keyboard tabs won't appear after installing and uninstalling the software multiple times which makes this device useless. Was so excited when I got it, and can't beleive the lack of functioning software is forcing me to return it.|Lady Montana|February 11, 2010
It's Plug-n-Play- no need for the drivers.It is gorgeous, has tons of functionality for a little thing that fits in a remote caddy. Just flip a switch to toggle between remote and keyboard functions (which I do constantly when web browsing).The pad is easy to use even in mouse mode (just set the mouse speed to fastest). The cover looks cool and keeps dust out of this little investment ;).Someone wrote it doesn't scroll but it does on web browsers. Ensure the cursor is positioned on the page then toggle to remote mode and hold down any of the arrows on the pad to scroll web pages.Agree it should have functions for F keys like pressing a combination of function+1 for F1.I'd dump the WMP button to expand the keyboard and add a dedicated delete button so it isn't a function.I wish the back button was split in two so could have a forward button too.I'd like a DVD/BD player menu button (function ok) added to one of the media keys.It would be perfect if it had learning capability on some keys so could re-purpose them. Would love to incorporate my receiver's volume into it as I don't control volume from the PC- who does on an HTPC? The price is high for this w/out at least some programming capability.Agree the function text should not be blue because it can't be read in the dark. Perhaps yellow?The cursor cannot be controlled if set the windows font larger than 150pts, and on an HTPC we like GIANT text. So I am squinting to read windows. (Vista and 7x64)It loses connection to the receiver quite a bit, especially when the battery is low. Must pull out the battery and re-install it to re-connect.My battery does not last a month- not even close. I use it heavily though, browsing the web, twitter etc.. I don't just pop movies in and put it down.The recharger pin has a loose connection with the unit and easily falls out, so it's difficult to use it while recharging.Would be great if there was a deluxe edition that included integration to an internal PC power switch to turn ON the PC from the couch (if possible).|AnneM|February 11, 2010
Welcome to the 21st cemtury of home enterainment!!! I am glad that logitech has been able to develope a wireless pad that does everything with so much ease. it may take a little getting used to but now that i am i can acctually type faster with this handheld device than i can with a full keaybord. The hot keys that automaticly open up your media player and open internet exploerer snd put your computer to sleep are great options. the click pad or mouse pad like i call it is super eay to use and fun to play with. i can surf the web faster than i thought possible with this tool. I might not be the best speller in the world but i typed this entire review with the diNovo mini in half the time it would take me to type with a regular keybord!!!!!! Highly reccomended great product.|Jlude|January 31, 2010
I got the Mini originally to use with my PS3 and it works great. Eventually we got tierd of surfing through the PS3 and hooked a PC upto the TV because the PS3 was a bit awkward to use. We now use the Mini on the PC and haven't had any problems with it. F keys would be nice. Even if they were a key combination (Function+1 , Function +2 etc). The only other thing that I could see to improve it would be a charging dock. I have way too many transformers and it's always a fun game finding the right one. If it breaks I'll definately be buying another one.|Jesse|December 22, 2009
I loved this all in one remote. Works a treat in the lounge room with my HTPC, battery life is great, works from a great distance and easily able to search and mouse driven application. The cover feels a little flimsy but does not distract from the product. Looks great on coffee table. Highly recommend it. Sam.|Sam From Aus|December 20, 2009
I've had this for a few years and I love it. I use this on an Ubuntu based HTPC in conjunction with my Harmony 880. It plugs right in with no configuration required. It would be cumbersome to use it as your primary remote as you need two hands to use it comfortably. I'm of two minds on the lid, I like that I can close it up and avoid random key presses but it can kind of get in the way when it's open. The battery life is fantastic, I barely ever have to recharge it, maybe once a month, but again, I don't use it as my primary remote. It would be nice to connect it as a bluetooth device without using the dongle it comes with but that's not a major gripe. Every once in a while it stops responding so I pull out the battery, push a few buttons to drain capacitors, plug the battery back in and it's good to go. The main feature I would like to see added is function key support (F1, F2, etc.) which would be especially handy in managing a Linux machine.|McDoh|November 24, 2009
1. insert the usb plug2. press connect on the plug and device3. doneI didn´t even install any drivers and it works like a charmi miss the f buttons but they are not neeed since i use it for couch surfing and movie watching on my lcd tv.for once the product actually corresponded with what i excpected it to be.|zalbo|October 16, 2009
This keyboard + mouse is great, works from 30 feet flawlessly. I use it for AIM/Messaging and it is awesome. I love how I can easily switch from PS3 to PC mode without having to break it apart.I do have to tell you tho, that it doesn't seem to have any F keys, but that's fine for most people, If needed, I just hook up another keyboard to the pc and solve that. It would be nice to have some F keys on there in the future, seems like I'm not the only one who wants it.|TheOne|August 24, 2009
This worked for 48 hours and then the blue tooth receiver disappeared from devices. Ordered new receiver, same thing. Under no circumstances buy this.|disgruntled|August 5, 2009
A major oversight is the lack of F keys. This makes it impossible to..say ... install windows (getting past the license agreement) getting into your bios... or just plain pressing an F key.I can not believe there is not some sort of fix for this.|Stuart|June 21, 2009
If you have a laptop that you regularly hook up to a tv you will want this. I say laptop because of the portability the DiNovo Mini offers, a full-time pc hookup may work better with a full sized wireless keyboard. The mini is great for throwing in the bag when you go on a business trip or travel. The Mini is also great for group projects where multiple people need to see the screen and you don't want to block anyone's view. I'd say it is best for peck typing, mostly just thumbs while holding it or you can put down and peck with a few fingers for a bit faster input. The touch pad works great, it does take a bit of getting used to and I had to speed up the track speed. click and drag can be a problem given the small touch area but that has not been a big issue. Finally, battery life has been outstanding. truly over a month per charge.|duckdive|June 9, 2009
Wires in the living room has always been a cosmetic issue at my house, so i've always been on the lookout for wireless input devices. After sampling dozens of wireless keyboards and mice (and filling my closet with more and more useless clutter), my purchase of the Logitch diNovo has assured me that I can stop my search. I definitely plan on getting one of these for every computer that i use primarily as a media center.I was initially met with resistance when trying to run the software to use it. Basic drivers installed without an issue, but it was giving me errors installing the extra software included on the disc. This turned out to be a pain and still didn't finish installation even after following all of the "suggested steps" (restarting computer, disabling antivirus...etc). Assuming the issue lied with Vista, I installed it on my PC in my bedroom (XP) and sailed perfectly through all the setup. I was weary about the "flimsy" cover people warned about, but was surprised at the durability of it. Maybe sitting on it while it is open might damage it, but it seemed soundly designed.Battery life was another top priority and I wanted to stay away from disposable batteries as much as possible. The diNovo features a hefty rechargable battery advertised to give you about a month of charge time. I believe the battery may last so long because the unit enters a standby mode when the lid is closed, a great solution to the problem of dead wireless mice i was always encountering. It also recharges by the included wall adapter so i had no issues charging when i first got it (and not needing to sit in the middle of the living room floor by the computer to do so).The touchpad has 2 options (selectable by a switch) so you can either use it as a D-Pad or a mouse, and this made both file access and web browsing a breeze. The convenient "page up" and "page down" buttons also made browsing webpages much faster.I have found no issues with this device and would recommend it to anyone who is comfortable using a QWERTY keypad and wants an effective living room controller.|Fredboy|May 22, 2009
I've steadily moved away from "TV" and now watch most if not all of what I watch via iTunes (LOST), Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, etc. etc. I hook the laptop up to the big HDTV and Bingo! it's great. Except... get up to mess with the PC, sit down, get up, sit down, etc. I though, "A wireless keyboard or mouse would sure help." But I dredded a big wireless desktop keyboard and mouse, trying to figure out what surface to use the mouse on, and just the clutter of it all. I dreamed of a small wireless keyboard with a built in touchpad.Then, I saw it on the shelf at MicroCenter! This this is EXACTLY what I would have designed and just what I was looking for. And better: rechargable battery (rather than eating AA's). Programable specialty keys that map to certain media applications. Sweet looking package with clamshell cover and cool lighting. Just perfect.|Smokehouse|May 8, 2009
