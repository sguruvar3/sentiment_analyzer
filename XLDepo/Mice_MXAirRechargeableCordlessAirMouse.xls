Battery fully charged at 100% lasts no more than 1 day.See the screenshot attached.|q8|September 1, 2010
Unbelievably interesting air pointing. only one problem, that battery holds for shorter time than program shows.one day shows 5 days left, second day shows 2 days left. Need get a bit practice for using that tricky middle inertia scrolling button. anything else looks cool.|Elniasg|August 19, 2010
This mouse is great. If you find yourself kicked back in your seat at times while working on your PC, You'll love this mouse. It shouldn't even be called a mouse. It's so inovative! I absolutely love it. I lean back in my chair, comfortable with keyboard in lap and work all day. No more being stuck to a table or desk. Take my advice, from a Microsoft IT Certified Professional, and pick one up today and give it a try. You'll fall in love. I know it's a bit pricey but it is work the money. Check the web, you'll find one. The Logitech MX Airâ„¢ & Logitech Illuminated Keybaord, my setup, the ultimate in technology and confort! The DiNovo is also great but I needed the Illumination. Logitech did it again! Buy One, Try One, You'll absolutely love it. It is my day-to-day device. Thanks, R.O.|ROBrien|April 12, 2010
It works excellent with CAD programs, so smooth; and in Mac, it's so cool you can use your Expose and Dashboard from the secondary mouse buttons!It's awesome!!!|Apple|April 5, 2010
This really is the best airmouse I've used. Most air mice have a gittery feel and look to them which makes it skip across the screen. This one has stabilizing software built in so it doesn't do that.I've owned this mouse for about 2 years now and it has held up to daily use.I use it for a media center in my living room. After about a week my wife and I stopped using the old remote. This one does almost everything I need.The only recommendation I would make to logitech is to add a IR universal remote buttons to it somehow. That way I could also power on the TV and stereo and control the volume on the receiver.Basically I need a combination Air Mouse and Universal Remote.|Joeschmoe|March 12, 2010
IT IS truely an awseom product.. but I have Vista 64 and the volume does not control computer volume - not sure about the bug there.Does not switch from air mode to regular mouse mode easily... actually I use this with my regular TV where the PC is my PVR - it ROCKS!I'd like to see this have a remote channel changer, etc on there as well... I'm suren newer models will have this.It is revolutionary! I likes it!|Swanson Jones|March 10, 2010
It's all worth it.Smooth, high quality, perfect ergonometry, precise, unequivocal, well-defined, accurate.Just perfect.|Cesaro|March 6, 2010
I really hope that Logitech keep up with this kind of mouse. Its very competent for CAD work because of the lack of the wheel in the middle, and replacing it with the scroll capacitive bar hasn't slowed me down. For CAD you need to have that positive third middle click and wheels get uncomfortable after a while. To be honest I've rarely used the off-desk feature but the form factor is comfortable nonetheless, if maybe 10% small (and I don't have large hands). Please make a dedicated CAD mouse with features and styling like this one, industrial designers would really appreciate it!|CADmonkey|February 13, 2010
I've bought this mouse for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift. I tried it to use and it's so wonderful! I hope that it'll be nice surpise. The price is higher, but price = quality. I reccomend!|Simona|December 21, 2009
The mouse has a wonderful elegant design performs perfectly and as soon as you get it in the air the big price begins to make sence. Its battery life is more than long enough for the ultimate experience. The mouse is feels very comfortable and even though it might not seem to follow the lines of the palm it perfectly fits the it. In my opinion it with addition to dinovo edge keyboard would be the best combo. I completely encourage veryone to buy it and assure them that they wont regret choosing it.|monito9613|December 19, 2009
I have owned three of these mice, and i've noticed that the performance varies between them. I tried three of them only because the mouse is so attractive that I really wanted to have one that worked well. The mouse is, in fact, so attractive that it makes it's short comings almost worth living with. The first thing that I noticed about this mouse, when I took it out of the box, was that it felt cheap. The mouse felt very light in my hand, and, although some reviews have stated this to be a positive thing, I thought it was so light that it almost felt cheap. I wish that the beautiful metal looking underside was really made out of metal, but it is plastic and obviously so. The feel of the mouse is not crisp, but, instead, it's a bit flimsy. Another thing that bothered me about this mouse was the scroll pad is a section separate from the rest of the mouse, and, with two of the three mice that I used, this section worked its way loose so that, when I would slide my finger up and down it, it would shift back and forth. This, of course, wound up contributing to the cheap feel of the mouse.On the first mouse that I tried, the scroll pad was very sensitive, so that with one slide down I could achieve a five or six line scroll. With the other two, I could only achieve about a two line scroll, which became annoying.I don't get why Logitech didn't design a back button on the side of the mouse for your thumb? The mouse has a back button located on top for when you are using the mouse as a pointer, but when the mouse is on your desk you will be unable to use this feature. A back button would have been nice on such an expensive mouse.Finally, no darkfield. For a mouse in this price range, I expect all the bells and whistles. Logitech has designed darkfield technology, which makes laser mouse technology obsolete, but they didn't put darkfield in this mouse.In my opinion, this mouse is just not worth the money.|Farly|November 21, 2009
I have been using this mouse for over a year and I won't use anything else. A bit costly, but worth the price. Sometmes a bit flaky on the desktop, but works great in the air.|Phantom|November 18, 2009
Wow, the most elegant mouse out there for sure and has a feel of quality in hand! Beautiful design and easily installs it's self! The Air feature is a tremendous technology that works wonders when my computer is being viewed on my big screen, sitting back and watching videos or going through photos on my Sony HD TV is as easy as waving your hand in the air, no need for a flat surface! I really like the flick of the wrist volume control also. Has a decent battery life between charges. Kind of pricey, but well worth it!|jjs4you2|October 16, 2009
I run Windows MCE to my 50 inch plasma to stream photos and videos and TV shows. My universal remote worked fine for MCE, but when you have to do things outside of MCE (ie. on the desktop) the remote didn't work well. I toyed with a bunch of ideas and hated to VNC to my MCE from my laptop just to do something.... along came this air mouse!!! No desk required - I can sit on my couch and use my big screen with ease. Thanks Logitech. Great idea. Too bad it isn't integrated with my universal remote - I am still trying to get down to a single device to control ALL my media toys. Perhaps next year...|Hamtickle|September 15, 2009
Easily setup on Vista, works fine, I like the idea of pushing the curser against the edge to centre it. Only took a few minutes to get used to. Looks great, was a touch difficult to learn how best to hold it, otherwise feels good. Bonus that you can lay it flat and use it as a normal mouse. Worried it might get scratched easily. Would like to see a better macro program to invoke custom command from the buttons.|Securicorp|August 26, 2009
This is not near as good as the Nintendo Wii remote for the PC, not that I like that console. I suppose if it didn't make a baby rattle noise that can't be muted (only during one operation can it be), it would be decent as a game device or a mouse/pointer combo for companies to use. No good.|real deal|June 24, 2009
it is a great mouse. haven't had a single problem. works great on the desk or in the air. its really light and easy to hold. but try holding it for half an hour and your arm gets a bit tired. everyday use is GREAT, games are GREAT the volume is awesome. but dont use it in any flight simulators or first persons.worth the cost!!|Pagani0zonda|April 30, 2009
This mouse has 2 main features that sell it. all of the buttons and the ability to use it without a hard surface. I deeply enjoy them both. I read the other reviews and I agree with them all. It is basically a mouse that has started the next generation of mice. Bravo to Logitech for the excellent find. A bit overpriced though.|Xavious|April 10, 2009
When using this mouse in the air, when you click, the cursor freezes in place for a split second, probably for stability because if you're holding something and pressing a button on it, your hand, and therefore, the device, moves up and down. This translates to being unusable in gaming while in air. When you put it down on the desk it functions like an average mouse, but is far too light, non-ergonomic, and the shape of the mouse and placement of the laser sensor and its sliding feet allow it to tilt slightly, and the mouse thinks you've picked it up in the air and will not respond temporarily.this mouse would be great for classroom use with a projector, or with a media center PC and a large monitor at a distance.other than that, your arm gets a little tired of being in the air all the time. i use it more on the desktop than in the air. shame.|yourbrokenoven|March 5, 2009
Finally a mouse that does not make my wrist hurt.It's cool, too :)|J|March 4, 2009
