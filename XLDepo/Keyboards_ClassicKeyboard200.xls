I love this keyboard! I originally bought it for my PS3 to use for Linux, but when the Other OS feature was removed from the PS3, i stopped using this keyboard. I then bought my logitech mouse and headset, and decided I wanted to be a 'logitech fanboy', and I was getting sick of my old PS/2 port mouse, so i popped this right in! It's silent, types easily, and is comfy. Very good price!|Brendan McCoy|July 28, 2010
This is a simple keyboard and it does not have a whole lot of extra features, but it has what I need. If you are looking for a simple keyboard that is very comfortable, affordable, and easy to type on, look no further.|logitechal|April 24, 2010
Easy set-up.Perfect size.Backslash slash key moved to second row.Good tactical feel.Smaller lettering, but OK.Good incline (10%) with back feet engaged.|DanO|March 30, 2010
This will seriously make it hard to type because the keys are in the wrong places, trust me I bought one.|Bill|March 19, 2010
feels good looks good that what this keyboard have going for it I wish it when you type that the keys would click like some of the older type of keyboard use to do. I wish the riser on the bottom be longer I wish the keys on the keyboard was bigger and the letter to be a bit bigger as well.I had better logitch keyboards come on why is this keybard so wrost so far.|cyberghost|February 25, 2010
I was looking for a keyboard to work with my Apple laptop. On the tech spec's online it does not let you know it's Mac compatible but on the box it came in it says Mac OS X also and works great.|dog friend|February 12, 2010
I bought the first one a year ago for my son. At first the size bothered him, but now he dislikes bigger keyboards. I just bought another for myself and my daughter says that she would like one too. Tomorrow I will buy the third. In my opinion the only area this keyboard is lacking is extra keys for volume, music etc. that are not nessesary. The compactness of this keyboard is a huge plus, making extra room on our computer desks.|Krispekritter|January 1, 2010
First of all , the plastic quality is poor.The design is not ergonomic.It seems that the buttons are too slim which is pretty hard sometimes.I can't even type without looking at the keyboard !when typing , the hand position is not natural and sometimes hurts my forehand.It's also pretty noisy and not comfortable !|Kevin|September 15, 2009
For 14.99(little bit less in most stores), you don't expect to get much. This board does not intend to give much anyway, other than the standard features of your regular keyboards. However, this is a great product.After I got tired of my EX110 randomly deciding to lose signal/power, and deciding that after using the G11/G15 that they were too gimmicky for me, I decided to go spend 11 bucks to get one of these from wal-mart. Great keyboard so far, easy to use, wired, nice key presses. The quality is fine. After making the transition from the EX110 to this, I pretty much type as good as I did. My only complaint is that all of the keys seem to be either lower, or at a slant. I can't decide which.All in all, great keyboard for the price. I'd buy one just to have a backup.|Dajinn|August 20, 2009
My wireless keyboard that came with my computer went on the blink, needed a replacement quick. I went to office depot, this one seemed good for the price and had eye appeal.It is lacking in the comfort and ease of use and the keys are hard to read, the lettering is very small and hard to see . If you have any vision problem you would not want this keyboard and comfort is not one of its best points, especially if you use it a lot.|mimi|August 13, 2009
worst keyboard ever. so small , could not see theletters.to dark.|Aurora|July 4, 2009
I was some what suprised to see that the keys weren't very see able. I have low vision problems and would like to see more imprise lettering.|WOOD|June 27, 2009
This keyboard is really great. I am able to type fairly fast and it's so easy to find the keys. And as long as you remember the keys, it's easy to find them. The keyboard has a great feel and if you don't like it being flat it has tabs for elevating at a 5 - 10Â° angle for better comfort. I honestly think this is the best keyboard i have ever had. Plus, it's going on for 8 months strong. I highly recommend this keyboard.|Osiris19|June 20, 2009
My Microsoft keyboard died suddenly and I couldn't do anything on my computer without a keyboard. I ran up the street to my neighborhood Wal-Mart and this was all they had on hand. I've bought Logitech products before and was please with them, so I bought it, came home, plugged it up, and hated it right off the bat! It's so small, it should be for children. It's uncomfortable to key on and the thing is so small, I keep hitting the wrong keys because the keys are so close together! I've ordered a better keyboard online and will give this away as soon as it comes!|swk247|June 12, 2009
THIS ONLY SEEMS TO COME IN BLACK , I CAN SEE THE KEYS BETTER , WHEN THEY ARE WHITE , WITH BLACK LETTERS & NUMBERS.|COMPUTER TECH.|May 25, 2009
I bought this as a replacement for a different brand of keyboard that died after 3 months of light use. Since I don't need all the "bells and whistles" that seem to be common on alot of keyboards, this was an excellent choice.One note: I triple-boot between Windows XP, Windows 7 RC and Linux. Although the specs don't say it, this keyboard is compatable with every OS that I've used.|broiled|May 19, 2009
I bought this keyboard at five in the morning to replace my wireless one that broke. I wasn't expecting much for the price, but I was surprised. I was just planning to have it as temporary keyboard but I think I will use it permanently. Its compact and thin and it feels pretty well made. The key presses feel pretty nice as well, much better than other $20 keyboards i have used. If you see this on the shelf, i would just pick it up for the 13 bucks they ask for it. And it can never run out of batteries and needs no drivers!|cliffman|May 1, 2009
After about 4 months the number pad quit working and the computer just beeps when I press the num lock button. But for the low price I can afford to get another rather than going through the hassle of using the 3 year warranty.|memememe|April 8, 2009
I have been using the "Classic Keyboard 200" for over 3 months. I bought it originally as a temp replacement for a keyboard that had great tactical feel and key response until I could find a "good" keyboard. That was going to take at most, a few weeks. I'm still using this one. I'm very picky about the feel and action of a keyboard, this is not the best I've ever used, it just comes very very close, and for the money, it is VERY impressive. Obviously this keyboard is better, by far, in use, than it's price reflects. I've had fairly good luck with logitech products. Didn't like their webcams (instead use an old 3com home connect I've had for years), their keyboards have usually been VERY good for the money (this one is no exception), I am still HOOKED on the old red (light on bottom) and blue logitech optical mouse I've used for over 4 years (yes, 4, cleaned it inside once), I loved their old wireless headsets until they quit making them and all 3 of mine finally died (not as long lived as most of their products). So it was an EASY choice to drop around 14 bucks on this keyboard when in need of one to just "get by" with.Points: NONE of the keys malfunction or "error type", space bar is full width functional (you don't have to hit it in the center for it to work correctly like some keyboards), it's light and thin yet feels rather solid and didn't need drivers installed for XP pro, or XP home (I also plug it into my laptop at times, works instantly).Try a display in the store if they have one, if not, I doubt you'll need to return it if you buy it and take it home. I doubt it would live up to many or most gamers needs, it's just a good all around quality keyboard for surfing, typing and general computer usage. If all things gave this much bang for the buck, a new Lexus would be under 20 grand.P. S. I type around 80 words a minute and close to 4 hours most days, so this keyboard has seen real world usage.|I Critic|March 28, 2009
Although it's the bottom-of-the-line Logitech keyboard, it's simplicity and comfort make it worth getting. Very inexpensive and easy to find, this keyboard has what you need out of a keyboard, and that's what matters.|GPIA|January 19, 2009
