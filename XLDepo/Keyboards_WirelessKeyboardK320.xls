nice keyboard, you can change setting and changing hotkeys to what u want it to be use for. it easy to use plus it works on my xbox360|johmn john|June 3, 2010
This is a nice keyboard for the price. I was looking for a wireless keyboard (having a small receiver such as the unifying receiver was a must) with long battery life, a simple, normal layout and a number pad - I actually find extra shortcut and media keys to be distracting and a waste of space. I also am too accustomed to the classic keyboard layout that I find any deviations to be distracting (e.g. function keys, messing with the insert/delete/home/end/page up/page down block). So in that sense even this keyboard had too many shortcut keys, most of which I just ended up disabling using the setpoint software. Other than that, this is a fantastic keyboard that I will most likely be using for quite some time.|CaptainWerd|April 25, 2010
The keys are responsive, I like the feel as I'm typing. connecting the keyboard was a slice. Nothing difficult about it. Not one complaint yet.Ease of connection, the price is not that bad, and the most important thing when making a purchase... it does what I need it to do|The Wu|February 16, 2010
