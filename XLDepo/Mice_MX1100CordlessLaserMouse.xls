I had the MX 1000 when it first came out. Around 2004? That was a great mouse and just purchased this upgraded one. Nearly the same. Excellent mouse. Great grip. No weird placed buttons. Fits to your hand perfectly. Quality is superb. Very pleased with this mouse.|c1rcu1tn3rd|February 22, 2010
This mouse does everything well except moving the cursor to where I want it. It has a nice design that fits my hand, customizable buttons, and great scroll wheel. Out of the box it performed great, but after 1 week of use I could feel the accuracy slowly starting to deteriorate, but I put up with it because I loved the features. Now after one year, accuracy has degraded to the point where I'm now using a cheap $10 optical mouse instead. The MX1100 still works, but it has gotten to the point where selecting the right cell in Excel has become a chore. For such an expensive mouse, I thought it would be able to beat a $10 mouse after one year of use. I was wrong.|Disgruntled|September 9, 2010
This mouse has been the best mouse I've ever owned... I do illustration and graphic arts for a living and this mouse makes it all easier... The customizable buttons are great for adding commonly used Photoshop shortcuts... EXTREMELY comfortable! I've owned it for about a year now and I hope it lasts for many more to come.|J-rod|September 7, 2010
It fits my hand perfectly, nicely placed buttont and it doesnt lagg at all even if it's 2 meters awey.|Ivica197|August 29, 2010
After writing the previous review, I decided to move the receiver from the back of the PC to the front. I didn't want to use one of only two USB ports for this, but it seems to have solved the connection problem. So I gave this review five stars to balance out my previous review.It is ridiculous to have to relocate the receiver. My theory is that the connection was being broken by some type of RF interference from other cables or devices. It was surrounded by four cables on the back of the PC, so there may have been some cross talk or RFI/EMI issues.Whatever the cause, this problem should not occur, and Logitech should take a hard look at this issue.|Gripster|August 12, 2010
As others have stated, my MX1100 has a major flaw, real bad cursor lag. The cursor often sticks, locks up, or freezes. When that happens the buttons also stop working. After vigorous shaking the cursor will move again until the next seizure.This is unworkable and unacceptable. So far Logitech tech support has been unresponsive. I expect a free replacement, or exchange to another similar model.I really like the fit, function and features of this mouse, and I desperately want it to work.Help me Logitech!|Gripster|August 11, 2010
This mouse in the 2.4 rangedoes not workwell. Example: 'College student' on campus has 1000's of 2.4 wireless. The area you are in has many. You start to use your mouse with the 2.4 option and it lags, hmmm why you say. Here is why, 2.4 is crowded, every time a signal is sent every other 2.4 device that can seeit has to get in line, wait to send. You are sharing the air space with every other device visable to your mouse. Thats the way it works. Logitech has attempted to make the communication better to limit this with features in software, however it does not solve the issue and is like a bandaid on a severed leg. In addition each 2.4 device that is being used on campus diminishes the campus 2.4 wireless network, so in conclusion, no well thought out plan for connectionless device usage such as cordless phones, mice etc.. is effective if using the 2.4 wireless range. Anyone who says otherwise is leading you astray.|Wireless Expert|August 3, 2010
All in all, I'm very impressed. The programmable buttons and ergonomic design fits me well. I especially appreciate the application-specific programmable buttons that allow me to copy/paste directly from the mouse.My only complaint is the fact that it is exclusively a "right-handed" mouse. As a southpaw I long ago adjusted to using my right hand for a mouse so I thought I'd have no problem using the mouse. What I discovered, however, was that "right-handed" in this case meant that the functions of the left and right click buttons could not be reversed. And I'm a confirmed "reverser" even though I use my right hand for the mouse.Fortunately, the mouse is large enough to allow me to adjust to using the "left-click" button without too much adjustment.|jsh1120|July 26, 2010
I'm not happy with this mouse overall. It lags very often and makes it very difficult to use. I have read many reviews on other sites about the lagging issue. I'm not exactly sure what it is but it acts like it is a signal strength problem.Thing is there is absolutely nothing blocking the signal between the mouse and usb receiver. It's only about 18 inches away. When moving the mouse around sometimes the cursor sticks and then starts again often jumping. The only good things about this mouse is it is good build, fits great in your hand, good features, long lasting battery and good weight. I had the predecessor MX-1000 and it had no issues other than bad battery. If this mouse doesn't get better soon I'm going to get something new.|Matt|July 7, 2010
This mouse is very well suited to right hands; everything performs as Logitech says on their product page, so I won't go on how good things are: I already gave a 5/5 total score, so my opinion is obvious.What I can do is throw some light on the mouse problems:- the connection. It's killing me. I had to build a aluminium antenna just to make it work as it should be - I still have occasional problems. The mouse would lag and stick on the screen from time to time, games, applications, everything, even if it is only at 1 metre from the receiver. I took out every wireless device just to make it work... I never had such problems with any of my previous mice.- Setpoint software needs some polishing for Windows 7 and probably Vista too. It doesn't start as admin so if you want it to work in apps that launch with raised privileges, than you must make a task from Task Scheduler yourself. For a driver, I find that absolutely unforgivable.It also does not register the buttons perfectly, they must be pressed twice, and the first time something else happens, like you're in Opera/Firefox with a open name/password tab open and press the stealth button, to document flip. The first time it tries to input a name/password to the empty fields, and only a second click will open Flip 3D. These are minor problems but they should be known.Remember, in the end, if you don't consider building a antenna (5-10 mins) a great annoyance, you should try this mouse... and even better, you should try the whole Wave Pro set, that has this mouse, but rechargeable. It's much better like that, and I chose to go the Wave Pro way.|t0yz|July 7, 2010
I just switched to MX1100 and it is the best mouse I ever had! It is very comfortable to use, and very programmable!I am using +/- buttons as browser zoom in/out (in mac they are command and +/- buttons respectively) Using one button screen capture, programmed quick look to another button...It took 5 minutes to figure out the whole thing, and now I am hating myself about why I haven't started using this mouse before! Great product for $80! Great Job!It's just brilliant!|mrkaya|June 29, 2010
From an ergonomic and design point of view, this is a fantastic mouse. It has a quality build, very comfortable shape, good software support and responsive buttons all positioned brilliantly.Sadly the MX-1100 fails terribly in the absolute most vital area - performance. Lag is exceptionally noticeable and the mouse stutters terribly when making small movements. Clicking accurately on anything other than large icons is a terrible chore as minute movements are near impossible to perform.While I may have been an unlucky customer to get a faulty mouse from the factory, potential buyers should check online and note the regularity of complaints about lag and stuttering.I've bought a number of Logitech products and they've all been exceptional; the MX-1100 is the first that I've ever felt was flawed. I'm back to using my old wireless MX-Laser which always provided top performance.|Steve Oz|June 23, 2010
This is an excellent mouse. The mouse is very comfortable and accurate. I haven't experienced any lag with the mouse..The hyper-fast scroll wheel is nice, but not a must. I have found that I rarely have use for it, but it does have a nice weighty feel. If I spin it, I can make it keep spinning for 15 seconds, but there's no need, because even extraordinarily long pages (like a million digits of pi) are cut through in just a couple seconds.The customized buttons are very useful, and will increase your productivity. What's nice about SetPoint is that you can set the buttons to do whatever you want, and the functions can even change, depending on what program is active.The battery life is very long, and even after it says that the battery level is critical, you can continue using the same batteries for several more weeks (the reminder is a little annoying, though). If you find that the mouse is too heavy, you can even remove one of the batteries, and still maintain full functionality.The durability is also excellent. Six months with this mouse, and the only evidence that it has been used is faded print on the ratchet engage button. The Logitech logo hasn't even faded.The fact that it's wireless is not a drawback in any way. I have never experienced lag or dropouts (although I'm not in a very busy area RF-wise). There's no pairing to be done; it works as soon as you plug in the receiver.The one drawback is the receiver. It is not a nano receiver, like many of Logitech's other mice. Similarly, it doesn't have a Unifying receiver. While this is fine for desktop computers, travelers with laptops will find this a pain. The receiver doesn't store in the mouse, making it easy to lose. I assume the reason behind this is because they don't think that travelers will take this with them. I, however, find that this mouse is portable, and there are much bulkier things that people may take along with them.So, in conclusion, I would highly recommend this mouse work in one location. Business men who take their laptops with them may want to look at something with a more travel-friendly receiver.|Freddie|June 17, 2010
i bought this mouse to use with my notebook. i have big hands, and it fits right to them. the problem is that it has a HUGE receiver (so i gave it a not-so-good overall rating). what could be done for it? simple. they should ship it wit a tiny bluetooth dongle, and who got bluetooth on his PC/ Notebook, could simply use it, and not waste a precious USB port. is that so difficult? i am willing to buy a MSC, wich has only 2 USB ports (ridiculous) and one of them ocupied, is realy not good.|Lzingano|April 13, 2010
Works great, connects perfectly, no drop outs, no lagging, no sticky pointer problems. Excellent material quality and design.The button customization is very easy via the SetPoint software (download from Logitech). Buttons can be customized differently for specific applications. This is invaluable to people like me who like to fine-tune their tools.If you don't want the customization, just plug the connector in and wait a few seconds. Voilà, the mouse works, no effort or download needed.The mouse uses two AA batteries, so I don't have to wait for it to recharge and there is no risk or having to replace the whole mouse because the battery died. I always have AAs handy, so that's fine by me. Software and a led indicator on the mouse warn you about low battery.The shape is very comfy and the hand doesn't tire at all. The mouse is strictly right-handed, though (obvious from the picture).Most mice - especially the more advanced, many-buttoned mice - are designed for a guy's hand, which means they are too big for a girl (for me, at least) to use efficiently. I was very happy to find a mouse that fits my hand, and one where I can reach all the 10 buttons easily.Don't panic, guys, it works very well for a male-sized hand too, my brother loves it :)The only problem I had was weight. With two AA batteries inserted, the mouse became too heavy for my liking. I removed one of the batteries and left the mouse with just one battery and an empty spot. That fixed it.I've used Logitech products for years - invariably to my greatest satisfaction. Once again, I'm very pleased with buying yet another one of their mice.|Kirenno|March 29, 2010
the mouse pointer lag all the time!!!!It is brand new but it is not workin properly.My old mouse is much better so I will have to use it again :)|vania|March 19, 2010
the mouse pointer moves inadequate!!!!It is brand new but thats all, so now I will have to try to sell it on ebay.My 5 years old mouse is much better so I will have to use it again :)|heidan|March 19, 2010
I really really loved, it does worth every single Lira/Dolar/Euro u spend for..Dont let the pictures trick you down as its huge and useless,it has the best ergonomy for a mouse. Great features.Being able to set every single button of it is another thing..Strongly recomended.|Free_Smile|March 14, 2010
I wanted to get a more advanced mouse for my office computer and found the MX 1100 and once i read about it's feature and style i knew i wanted it. I bought it and it is as good as advertised. So Good a few more employees said they may invest in one the same model. Way to go Logitech!|Novarian 26|February 7, 2010
This mouse lags too much. It's fast but it gets "stuck". For the price, I was hoping for a much better response. I had an old roller ball mouse that was so comfortable I didn't want to give it up until I found this one. It's comfortable, although a bit wide and has nice features but I'm not thrilled with it.|deener|February 1, 2010
